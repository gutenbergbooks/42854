<p><span class="bold">MAGNETITE,<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> a mineral forming the natural magnet (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Magnetism</a></span>), and important also as an iron-ore. It is an iron-black,
opaque mineral, with metallic lustre; hardness about 6,
sp. gr. 4.9 to 5.2. When scratched, it yields a black streak. It
is an oxide of iron having the formula Fe<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">4</span>, corresponding
with 72.4% of metal, whence its great value as an ore. It may
be regarded as a ferroso-ferric oxide, FeO·Fe<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span>, or as iron
ferrate, Fe&Prime;Fe<span class="su">2</span>&Prime;&prime;O<span class="su">4</span>. Titanium is often present, and occasionally
the mineral contains magnesium, nickel, &amp;c. It is always
strongly magnetic. Magnetite crystallizes in the cubic system,
usually in octahedra, less commonly in rhombic dodecahedra,
and not infrequently in twins of the &ldquo;spinel type&rdquo; (fig. 1). The
rhombic faces of the dodecahedron are
often striated parallel to the longer
diagonal. There is no distinct cleavage,
but imperfect parting may be
obtained along octahedral planes.</p>

<p>Magnetite is a mineral of wide distribution,
occurring as grains in many
massive and volcanic rocks, like
granite, diorite and dolerite. It appears
to have crystallized from the
magma at a very early period of consolidation.
Its presence contributes to
the dark colour of many basalts and other basic rocks, and may
cause them to disturb the compass. Large ore-bodies of granular
and compact magnetite occur as beds and lenticular masses in
Archean gneiss and crystalline schists, in various parts of Norway,
Sweden, Finland and the Urals; as also in the states of New York,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Michigan, as well as in Canada.
In some cases it appears to have segregated from a basic eruptive
magma, and in other cases to have resulted from metamorphic
action. Certain deposits appear to have been formed, directly
or indirectly, by wet processes. Iron rust sometimes contains
magnetite. An interesting deposit of oolitic magnetic ore occurs
in the Dogger (Inferior Oolite) of Rosedale Abbey, in Yorkshire;
and a somewhat similar pisolitic ore, of Jurassic age, is known on
the continent as chamoisite, having been named from Chamoison
(or Chamoson) in the Valais, Switzerland. Grains of magnetite
occur in serpentine, as an alteration-product of the olivine. In
emery, magnetite in a granular form is largely associated with
the corundum; and in certain kinds of mica magnetite occurs
as thin dendritic enclosures. Haematite is sometimes magnetic,
and A. Liversidge has shown that magnetite is probably present.
By deoxidation, haematite may be converted into magnetite,
as proved by certain pseudomorphs; but on the other hand
magnetite is sometimes altered to haematite. On weathering,
magnetite commonly passes into limonite, the ferrous oxide
having probably been removed by carbonated waters. Closely
related to magnetite is the rare volcanic mineral from Vesuvius,
called magnoferrite, or magnesioferrite, with the formula
MgFe<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">4</span>; and with this may be mentioned a mineral from
Jakobsberg, in Vermland, Sweden, called jakobsite, containing
MnFe<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">4</span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAGNETOGRAPH,<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> an instrument for continuously recording
the values of the magnetic elements, the three universally chosen
being the declination, the horizontal component and the vertical
component (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Terrestrial Magnetism</a></span>). In each case the
magnetograph only records the variation of the element, the
absolute values being determined by making observations in
the neighbourhood with the unifilar magnetometer (<i>q.v.</i>) and
inclinometer (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Declination.</i>&mdash;The changes in declination are obtained by means
of a magnet which is suspended by a long fibre and carries a mirror,
immediately below which a fixed mirror is attached to the base of
the instrument. Both mirrors are usually concave; if plane, a concave
lens is placed immediately before them. Light passing through
a vertical slit falls upon the mirrors, from which it is reflected,
and two images of the slit are produced, one by the movable mirror
attached to the magnet and the other by the fixed mirror. These
images would be short lines of light; but a piano-cylindrical lens is
placed with its axis horizontal just in front of the recording surface.
In this way a spot of light is obtained from each mirror. The recording
surface is a sheet of photographic paper wrapped round a drum
which is rotated at a constant speed by clockwork about a horizontal
axis. The light reflected from the fixed mirror traces a straight line
on the paper, serving as a base line from which the variations in
declination are measured. As the declination changes the spot of
light reflected from the magnet mirror moves parallel to the axis of
the recording drum, and hence the distance between the line traced
by this spot and the base line gives, for any instant, on an arbitrary
scale the difference between the declination and a constant angle,
namely, the declination corresponding to the base line. The value
of this constant angle is obtained by comparing the record with the
value for the declination as measured with a magnetometer. The
value in terms of arc of the scale of the record can be obtained by
measuring the distance between the magnet mirror and the recording
drum, and in most observations it is such that a millimetre on the
record represents one minute of arc. The time scale ordinarily
employed is 15 mm. per hour, but in modern instruments provision
is generally made for the time scale to be increased at will to 180 mm.
per hour, so that the more rapid variations of the declination can be
followed. The advantages of using small magnets, so that their
moment of inertia may be small and hence they may be able to
respond to rapid changes in the earth&rsquo;s field, were first insisted upon
by E. Mascart,<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> while M. Eschenhagen<a name="fa2a" id="fa2a" href="#ft2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a> first designed a set of
magnetographs in which this idea of small moment of inertia was
carried to its useful limit, the magnets only weighing 1.5 gram each,
and the suspension consisting of a very fine quartz fibre.</p>

<p><i>Horizontal Force.</i>&mdash;The variation of the horizontal force is obtained
by the motion of a magnet which is carried either by a bifilar suspension
or by a fairly stiff metal wire or quartz fibre. The upper
end of the suspension is turned till the axis of the magnet is at
right angles to the magnetic meridian. In this position the magnet
is in equilibrium under the action of the torsion of the suspension
and the couple exerted by the horizontal component, H, of the
earth&rsquo;s field, this couple depending on the product of H into the
magnetic moment, M, of the magnet. Hence if H varies the magnet
will rotate in such a way that the couple due to torsion is equal to the
new value of H multiplied by M. Since the movements of the
magnet are always small, the rotation of the magnet is proportional
to the change in H, so long as M and the couple, &theta;, corresponding
to unit twist of the suspension system remain constant. When
the temperature changes, however, both M and &theta; in general change.
With rise of temperature M decreases, and this alone will produce
the same effect as would a decrease in H. To allow for this effect
of temperature a compensating system of metal bars is attached
to the upper end of the bifilar suspension, so arranged that with
rise of temperature the fibres are brought nearer together and hence
the value of &theta; decreases. Since such a decrease in &theta; would by
itself cause the magnet to turn in the same direction as if H had
increased, it is possible in a great measure to neutralize the effects
of temperature on the reading of the instrument. In the case of
the unifilar suspension, the provision of a temperature compensation
is not so easy, so that what is generally done is to protect the instrument
from temperature variation as much as possible and then
to correct the indications so as to allow for the residual changes, a
continuous record of the temperature being kept by a recording
thermograph attached to the instrument. In the Eschenhagen
pattern instrument, in which a single quartz fibre is used for the
suspension, two magnets are placed in the vicinity of the suspended
magnet and are so arranged that their field partly neutralizes the
earth&rsquo;s field; thus the torsion required to hold the magnet with its
axis perpendicular to the earth&rsquo;s field is reduced, and the arrangement
permits of the sensitiveness being altered by changing the
position of the deflecting magnets. Further, by suitably choosing
the positions of the deflectors and the coefficient of torsion of the
fibre, it is possible to make the temperature coefficient vanish.
(See Adolf Schmidt, <i>Zeits. für Instrumentenkunde</i>, 1907, 27, 145.)
The method of recording the variations in H is exactly the same
as that adopted in the case of the declination, and the sensitiveness
generally adopted is such that 1 mm. on the record represents a
change in H of .00005 C.G.S., the time scale being the same as that
employed in the case of the declination.</p>

<p><i>Vertical Component.</i>&mdash;To record the variations of the vertical
component use is made of a magnet mounted on knife edges so
that it can turn freely about a horizontal axis at right angles to its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386"></a>386</span>
length (H. Lloyd, <i>Proc. Roy. Irish Acad.</i>, 1839, 1, 334). The
magnet is so weighted that its axis is approximately horizontal, and
any change in the inclination of the axis is observed by means of
an attached mirror, a second mirror fixed to the stand serving to
give a base line for the records, which are obtained in the same
way as in the case of the declination. The magnet is in equilibrium
under the influence of the couple VM due to the vertical component
V, and the couple due to the fact that the centre of gravity is slightly
on one side of the knife-edge. Hence when, say, V decreases the
couple VM decreases, and hence the north end of the balanced
magnet rises, and vice versa. The chief difficulty with this form of
instrument is that it is very sensitive to changes of temperature,
for such changes not only alter M but also in general cause the
centre of gravity of the system to be displaced with reference to
the knife-edge. To reduce these effects the magnet is fitted with
compensating bars, generally of zinc, so adjusted by trial that as
far as possible they neutralize the effect of changes of temperature.
In the Eschenhagen form of vertical force balance two deflecting
magnets are used to partly neutralize the vertical component, so
that the centre of gravity is almost exactly over the support. By
varying the positions of these deflecting magnets it is possible to
compensate for the effects of changes of temperature (A. Schmidt,
<i>loc. cit.</i>). In order to eliminate the irregularity which is apt to be
introduced by dust, &amp;c., interfering with the working of the knife-edge,
W. Watson (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>, 1904 [6], 7, 393) designed a form of
vertical force balance in which the magnet with its mirror is attached
to the mid point of a horizontal stretched quartz fibre. The temperature
compensation is obtained by attaching a small weight to
the magnet, and then bringing it back to the horizontal position by
twisting the fibre.</p>

<p>The scale values of the records given by the horizontal and
vertical force magnetographs are determined by deflecting the
respective needles, either by means of a magnet placed at a known
distance or by passing an electric current through circular coils
of large diameter surrounding the instruments.</p>

<p>The width of the photographic sheet which receives the spot of
light reflected from the mirrors in the above instruments is generally
so great that in the case of ordinary changes the curve does not go
off the paper. Occasionally, however, during a disturbance such
is not the case, and hence a portion of the trace would be lost. To
overcome this difficulty Eschenhagen in his earlier type of instruments
attached to each magnet two mirrors, their planes being
inclined at a small angle so that when the spot reflected from one
mirror goes off the paper, that corresponding to the other comes on.
In the later pattern a third mirror is added of which the plane is
inclined at about 30° to the horizontal. The light from the slit
is reflected on to this mirror by an inclined fixed mirror, and after
reflection at the movable mirror is again reflected at the fixed mirror
and so reaches the recording drum. By this arrangement the angular
rotation of the reflected beam is less than that of the magnet,
and hence the spot of light reflected from this mirror yields a trace
on a much smaller scale than that given by the ordinary mirror
and serves to give a complete record of even the most energetic
disturbance.</p>

<p>The effects of temperature being so marked on the readings of
the horizontal and vertical force magnetographs, it is usual to place
the instruments either in an underground room or in a room which,
by means of double walls and similar devices, is protected as much
as possible from temperature changes. For descriptions of the

<p><span class="bold">MAGNETOMETER,<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> a name, in its most general sense, for
any instrument used to measure the strength of any magnetic
field; it is, however, often used in the restricted sense of an
instrument for measuring a particular magnetic field, namely,
that due to the earth&rsquo;s magnetism, and in this article the instruments
used for measuring the value of the earth&rsquo;s magnetic
field will alone be considered.</p>

<p>The elements which are actually measured when determining
the value of the earth&rsquo;s field are usually the declination, the dip

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Measurement of Declination.</i>&mdash;The measurement of the declination
involves two separate observations, namely, the determination
of (<i>a</i>) the magnetic meridian and (<i>b</i>) the geographical meridian,
the angle between the two being the declination. In order
to determine the magnetic meridian the orientation of the magnetic
axis of a freely suspended magnet is observed; while, in the absence
of a distant mark of which the azimuth is known, the geographical
meridian is obtained from observations of the transit of the sun
or a star. The geometrical axis of the magnet is sometimes defined
by means of a mirror rigidly attached to the magnet and having the
normal to the mirror as nearly as may be parallel to the magnetic
axis. This arrangement is not very convenient, as it is difficult to
protect the mirror from accidental displacement, so that the angle
between the geometrical and magnetic axes may vary. For this
reason the end of the magnet is sometimes polished and acts as the
mirror, in which case no displacement of the reflecting surface with
reference to the magnet is possible. A different arrangement, used
in the instrument described below, consists in having the magnet
hollow, with a small scale engraved on glass firmly attached at one
end, while to the other end is attached a lens, so chosen that the
scale is at its principal focus. In this case the geometrical axis is
the line joining the central division of the scale to the optical centre
of the lens. The position of the magnet is observed by means of a
small telescope, and since the scale is at the principal focus of the
lens, the scale will be in focus when the telescope is adjusted to
observe a distant object. Thus no alteration in the focus of the
telescope is necessary whether we are observing the magnet, a distant
fixed mark, or the sun.</p>

<p>The Kew Observatory pattern unifilar magnetometer is shown in
figs. 1 and 2. The magnet consists of a hollow steel cylinder fitted
with a scale and lens as described above, and is suspended by a long
thread of unspun silk, which is attached at the upper end to the
torsion head H. The magnet is protected from draughts by the
box A, which is closed at the sides by two shutters when an observation
is being taken. The telescope B serves to observe the scale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id="page387"></a>387</span>
attached to the magnet when determining the magnetic meridian,
and to observe the sun or star when determining the geographical
meridian.</p>

<p>When making a determination of declination a brass plummet
having the same weight as the magnet is first suspended in its place,
and the torsion of the fibre is taken out. The magnet having been
attached, the instrument is rotated about its vertical axis till the
centre division of the scale appears to coincide with the vertical
cross-wire of the telescope. The two verniers on the azimuth circle
having been read, the magnet is then inverted, <i>i.e.</i> turned through
180° about its axis, and the setting is repeated. A second setting
with the magnet inverted is generally made, and then another
setting with the magnet in its original position. The mean of all
the readings of the verniers gives the reading on the azimuth circle
corresponding to the magnetic meridian. To obtain the geographical
meridian the box A is removed, and an image of the sun or a star is
reflected into the telescope B by means of a small transit mirror N.
This mirror can rotate about a horizontal axis which is at right
angles to the line of collimation of the telescope, and is parallel
to the surface of the mirror. The time of transit of the sun or star
across the vertical wire of the telescope having been observed by
means of a chronometer of which the error is known, it is possible to
calculate the azimuth of the sun or star, if the latitude and longitude
of the place of observation are given. Hence if the readings of
the verniers on the azimuth circle are made when the transit is
observed we can deduce the reading corresponding to the geographical
meridian.</p>

<p>The above method of determining the geographical meridian has
the serious objection that it is necessary to know the error of the
chronometer with very considerable accuracy, a matter of some
difficulty when observing at any distance from a fixed observatory.
If, however, a theodolite, fitted with a telescope which can rotate
about a horizontal axis and having an altitude circle, is employed,
so that when observing a transit the altitude of the sun or star
can be read off, then the time need only be known to within a minute
or so. Hence in more recent patterns of magnetometer it is usual
to do away with the transit mirror method of observing and either
to use a separate theodolite to observe the azimuth of some distant
object, which will then act as a fixed mark when making the declination
observations, or to attach to the magnetometer an altitude
telescope and circle for use when determining the geographical
meridian.</p>

<p>The chief uncertainty in declination observations, at any rate at a
fixed observatory, lies in the variable torsion of the silk suspension,
as it is found that, although the fibre may be entirely freed from
torsion before beginning the declination observations, yet at the
conclusion of these observations a considerable amount of torsion
may have appeared. Soaking the fibre with glycerine, so that the
moisture it absorbs does not change so much with the hygrometric
state of the air, is of some advantage, but does not entirely remove
the difficulty. For this reason some observers use a thin strip
of phosphor bronze to suspend the magnet, considering that the
absence of a variable torsion more than compensates for the increased
difficulty in handling the more fragile metallic suspension.</p>

<p><i>Measurement of the Horizontal Component of the Earth&rsquo;s Field.</i>&mdash;The
method of measuring the horizontal component which is
almost exclusively used, both in fixed observatories and in the
field, consists in observing the period of a freely suspended
magnet, and then obtaining the angle through which an auxiliary
suspended magnet is deflected by the magnet used in the first part
of the experiment. By the vibration experiment we obtain the
value of the product of the magnetic moment (M) of the magnet
into the horizontal component (H), while by the deflexion experiment
we can deduce the value of the ratio of M to H, and hence the
two combined give both M and H.</p>

<p>In the case of the Kew pattern unifilar the same magnet that is
used for the declination is usually employed for determining H,
and for the purposes of the vibration experiment it is mounted as
for the observation of the magnetic meridian. The time of vibration
is obtained by means of a chronometer, using the eye-and-ear
method. The temperature of the magnet must also be observed,
for which purpose a thermometer C (fig. 1) is attached to the box A.</p>

<p>When making the deflection experiment the magnetometer is
arranged as shown in fig. 2. The auxiliary magnet has a plane
mirror attached, the plane of
which is at right angles to the
axis of the magnet. An image
of the ivory scale B is observed
after reflection in the magnet
mirror by the telescope A. The
magnet K used in the vibration
experiment is supported on a
carriage L which can slide along
the graduated bar D. The axis
of the magnet is horizontal and
at the same level as the mirror
magnet, while when the central
division of the scale B appears
to coincide with the vertical
cross-wire of the telescope the
axes of the two magnets are at
right angles. During the experiment
the mirror magnet is
protected from draughts by two
wooden doors which slide in
grooves. What is known as the
method of sines is used, for since
the axes of the two magnets are
always at right angles when the
mirror magnet is in its zero position,
the ratio M/H is proportional
to the sine of the angle
between the magnetic axis of the
mirror magnet and the magnetic
meridian. When conducting a
deflexion experiment the deflecting
magnet K is placed
with its centre at 30 cm. from
the mirror magnet and to the east of the latter, and the whole
instrument is turned till the centre division of the scale B coincides
with the cross-wire of the telescope, when the readings of the
verniers on the azimuth circle are noted. The magnet K is then

between the two sets of readings gives twice the angle which the
magnetic axis of the mirror magnet makes with the magnetic
meridian. In order to eliminate any error due to the zero of the
scale D not being exactly below the mirror magnet, the support L
is then removed to the west side of the instrument, and the settings
are repeated. Further, to allow of a correction being applied for the
finite length of the magnets the whole series of settings is repeated with
the centre of the deflecting magnet at 40 cm. from the mirror magnet.</p>

and magnetic states of the two magnets. The value of the constants
P and Q can be obtained by making deflexion experiments at three
distances. It is, however, possible by suitably choosing the proportions
of the two magnets to cause either P or Q to be very small.
Thus it is usual, if the magnets are of similar shape, to make the
deflected magnet 0.467 of the length of the deflecting magnet, in
which case Q is negligible, and thus by means of deflexion experiments
at two distances the value of P can be obtained. (See C.

<p>In the case of the vibration experiment correction terms have to
be introduced to allow for the temperature of the magnet, for the
inductive effect of the earth&rsquo;s field, which slightly increases the
magnetic moment of the magnet, and for the torsion of the suspension
fibre, as well as the rate of the chronometer. If the temperature of
the magnet were always exactly the same in both the vibration and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id="page388"></a>388</span>
deflexion experiment, then no correction on account of the effect of
temperature in the magnetic moment would be necessary in either
experiment. The fact that the moment of inertia of the magnet
varies with the temperature must, however, be taken into account.
In the deflexion experiment, in addition to the induction correction,
and that for the effect of temperature on the magnetic moment, a
correction has to be applied for the effect of temperature on the
length of the bar which supports the deflexion magnet.</p>

<p><i>Measurements of the Magnetic Elements at Sea.</i>&mdash;Owing to the
fact that the proportion of the earth&rsquo;s surface covered by sea is
so much greater than the dry land, the <span class="correction" title="amended from determinaton">determination</span> of the
magnetic elements on board ship is a matter of very considerable
importance. The movements of a ship entirely preclude the
employment of any instrument in which a magnet suspended by
a fibre has any part, so that the unifilar is unsuited for such
observations. In order to obtain the declination a pivoted
magnet is used to obtain the magnetic meridian, the geographical
meridian being obtained by observations on the sun or stars.
A carefully made ship&rsquo;s compass is usually employed, though
in some cases the compass card, with its attached magnets, is
made reversible, so that the inclination to the zero of the card
of the magnetic axis of the system of magnets attached to the
card can be eliminated by reversal. In the absence of such a
reversible card the index correction must be determined by comparison
with a unifilar magnetometer, simultaneous observations
being made on shore, and these observations repeated as often as
occasion permits. To determine the dip a Fox&rsquo;s dip circle<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a> is
used. This consists of an ordinary dip circle (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Inclinometer</a></span>)
in which the ends of the axle of the needle are pointed and rest
in jewelled holes, so that the movements of the ship do not
displace the needle. The instrument is, of course, supported on
a gimballed table, while the ship during the observations is kept
on a fixed course. To obtain the <i>strength</i> of the field the method
usually adopted is that known as Lloyd&rsquo;s method.<a name="fa2b" id="fa2b" href="#ft2b"><span class="sp">2</span></a> To carry out
a determination of the total force by this method the Fox dip
circle has been slightly modified by E. W. Creak, and has been
found to give satisfactory results on board ship. The circle is
provided with two needles in addition to those used for determining
the dip, one (<i>a</i>) an ordinary dip needle, and the other (<i>b</i>)
a needle which has been loaded at one end by means of a small
peg which fits into one of two symmetrically placed holes in the
needle. The magnetism of these two needles is never reversed,
and they are as much as possible protected from shock and from
approach to other magnets, so that their magnetic state may remain
as constant as possible. Attached to the cross-arm which
carries the microscopes used to observe the ends of the dipping
needle is a clamp, which will hold the needle <i>b</i> in such a way that
its plane is parallel to the vertical circle and its axis is at right
angles to the line joining the two microscopes. Hence, when
the microscopes are adjusted so as to coincide with the points
of the dipping needle <i>a</i>, the axes of the two needles must be at
right angles. The needle <i>a</i> being suspended between the jewels,
and the needle <i>b</i> being held in the clamp, the cross-arm carrying
the reading microscopes and the needle <i>b</i> is rotated till the ends
of the needle a coincide with the cross-wires of the microscopes.
The verniers having been read, the cross-arm is rotated so as to
deflect the needle <i>a</i> in the opposite direction, and a new setting
is taken. Half the difference between the two readings gives
the angle through which the needle a has been deflected under
the action of the needle <i>b</i>. This angle depends on the ratio of
the magnetic moment of the needle <i>b</i> to the total force of the
earth&rsquo;s field. It also involves, of course, the distance between
the needles and the distribution of the magnetism of the needles;
but this factor is determined by comparing the value given by
the instrument, at a shore station, with that given by an ordinary
magnetometer. Hence the above observation gives us a
means of obtaining the <i>ratio</i> of the magnetic moment of the needle
<i>b</i> to the value of the earth&rsquo;s total force. The needle <i>b</i> is then
substituted for <i>a</i>, there being now no needle in the clamp attached
to the microscope arm, and the difference between the reading
now obtained and the dip, together with the weight added to the
needle, gives the product of the moment of the needle <i>b</i> into the
earth&rsquo;s total force. Hence, from the two observations the value
of the earth&rsquo;s total force can be deduced. In an actual observation
the deflecting needle would be reversed, as well as the deflected
one, while different weights would be used to deflect the needle <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>For a description of the method of using the Fox circle for observations
at sea consult the <i>Admiralty Manual of Scientific Inquiry</i>,
p. 116, while a description of the most recent form of the circle,
known as the Lloyd-Creak pattern, will be found in <i>Terrestrial
Magnetism</i>, 1901, 6, p. 119. An attachment to the ordinary ship&rsquo;s
compass, by means of which satisfactory measurements of the
horizontal component have been made on board ship, is described
by L. A. Bauer in <i>Terrestrial Magnetism</i>, 1906, 11, p. 78. The
principle of the method consists in deflecting the compass needle
by means of a horizontal magnet supported vertically over the
compass card, the axis of the deflecting magnet being always
perpendicular to the axis of the magnet attached to the card. The
method is not strictly an absolute one, since it presupposes a knowledge
of the magnetic moment of the deflecting magnet. In practice
it is found that a magnet can be prepared which, when suitably protected
from shock, &amp;c., retains its magnetic moment sufficiently
constant to enable observations of H to be made comparable in
accuracy with that of the other elements obtained by the instruments
ordinarily employed at sea.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAGNETO-OPTICS.<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> The first relation between magnetism
and light was discovered by Faraday,<a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> who proved that the
plane of polarization of a ray of light was rotated when the ray
travelled through certain substances parallel to the lines of magnetic
force. This power of rotating the plane of polarization in a
magnetic field has been shown to be possessed by all refracting
substances, whether they are in the solid, liquid or gaseous state.
The rotation by gases was established independently by H.
Becquerel,<a name="fa2c" id="fa2c" href="#ft2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a> and Kundt and Röntgen,<a name="fa3c" id="fa3c" href="#ft3c"><span class="sp">3</span></a> while Kundt<a name="fa4c" id="fa4c" href="#ft4c"><span class="sp">4</span></a> found that
films of the magnetic metals, iron, cobalt, nickel, thin enough to
be transparent, produced enormous rotations, these being in iron
and cobalt magnetized to saturation at the rate of 200,000° per
cm. of thickness, and in nickel about 89,000°. The direction
of rotation is not the same in all bodies. If we call the rotation
positive when it is related to the direction of the magnetic force,
like rotation and translation in a right-handed screw, or, what is
equivalent, when it is in the direction of the electric currents
which would produce a magnetic field in the same direction as
that which produces the rotation, then most substances produce
positive rotation. Among those that produce negative rotation
are ferrous and ferric salts, ferricyanide of potassium, the salts
of lanthanum, cerium and didymium, and chloride of titanium.<a name="fa5c" id="fa5c" href="#ft5c"><span class="sp">5</span></a></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The magnetic metals iron, nickel, cobalt, the salts of nickel and

<p>The variation of Verdet&rsquo;s constant with temperature has been

(<i>loc. cit.</i>). They find if R<span class="su">t</span>, R<span class="su">0</span> are the values of Verdet&rsquo;s constant
at t°C and 0°C. respectively, then for carbon bisulphide R<span class="su">t</span> = R<span class="su">0</span>
(1 &minus; .0016961), and for water R<span class="su">t</span> = R<span class="su">0</span> (1 &minus; .0000305t &minus; .00000305t²).</p>

<p>For the magnetic metals Kundt found that the rotation did not
increase so rapidly as the magnetic force, but that as this force was
increased the rotation reached a maximum value. This suggests
that the rotation is proportional to the intensity of magnetization,
and not to the magnetic force.</p>

<p>The amount of rotation in a given field depends greatly upon the
wave length of the light; the shorter the wave length the greater
the rotation, the rotation varying a little more rapidly than the
inverse square of the wave length. Verdet<a name="fa11c" id="fa11c" href="#ft11c"><span class="sp">11</span></a> has compared in the

is fair, the differences are greater than can be explained by
errors of experiment.</p>
</div>

<p>Verdet<a name="fa12c" id="fa12c" href="#ft12c"><span class="sp">12</span></a> has shown that the rotation of a salt solution is the
sum of the rotations due to the salt and the solvent; thus, by
mixing a salt which produces negative rotation with water which
produces positive rotation, it is possible to get a solution which
does not exhibit any rotation. Such solutions are not in general
magnetically neutral. By mixing diamagnetic and paramagnetic
substances we can get magnetically neutral solutions,
which, however, produce a finite rotation of the plane of polarization.
The relation of the magnetic rotation to chemical
<span class="correction" title="amended from consitution">constitution</span> has been studied in great detail by Perkin,<a name="fa13c" id="fa13c" href="#ft13c"><span class="sp">13</span></a> Wachsmuth,<a name="fa14c" id="fa14c" href="#ft14c"><span class="sp">14</span></a>

<p>The rotation of the plane of polarization may conveniently
be regarded as denoting that the velocity of propagation of
circular-polarized light travelling along the lines of magnetic force
depends upon the direction of rotation of the ray, the velocity
when the rotation is related to the direction of the magnetic
force, like rotation and translation on a right-handed screw
being different from that for a left-handed rotation. A plane-polarized
ray may be regarded as compounded of two oppositely
circularly-polarized rays, and as these travel along the lines of
magnetic force with different velocities, the one will gain or
lose in phase on the other, so that when they are again compounded
they will correspond to a plane-polarized ray, but in
consequence of the change of phase the plane of polarization
will not coincide with its original position.</p>

<p><i>Reflection from a Magnet.</i>&mdash;Kerr<a name="fa17c" id="fa17c" href="#ft17c"><span class="sp">17</span></a> in 1877 found that when
plane-polarized light is incident on the pole of an electromagnet,
polished so as to act like a mirror, the plane of polarization of
the reflected light is rotated by the magnet. Further experiments
on this phenomenon have been made by Righi,<a name="fa18c" id="fa18c" href="#ft18c"><span class="sp">18</span></a> Kundt,<a name="fa19c" id="fa19c" href="#ft19c"><span class="sp">19</span></a>
Du Bois,<a name="fa20c" id="fa20c" href="#ft20c"><span class="sp">20</span></a> Sissingh,<a name="fa21c" id="fa21c" href="#ft21c"><span class="sp">21</span></a> Hall,<a name="fa22c" id="fa22c" href="#ft22c"><span class="sp">22</span></a> Hurion,<a name="fa23c" id="fa23c" href="#ft23c"><span class="sp">23</span></a> Kaz<a name="fa24c" id="fa24c" href="#ft24c"><span class="sp">24</span></a> and Zeeman.<a name="fa25c" id="fa25c" href="#ft25c"><span class="sp">25</span></a> The
simplest case is when the incident plane-polarized light falls
normally on the pole of an electromagnet. When the magnet
is not excited the reflected ray is plane-polarized; when the
magnet is excited the plane of polarization is rotated through a
small angle, the direction of rotation being opposite to that of
the currents exciting the pole. Righi found that the reflected
light was slightly elliptically polarized, the axes of the ellipse
being of very unequal magnitude. A piece of gold-leaf placed
over the pole entirely stops the rotation, showing that it is not
produced in the air near the pole. Rotation takes place from
magnetized nickel and cobalt as well as from iron, and is in the
same direction (Hall). Righi has shown that the rotation at
reflection is greater for long waves than for short, whereas, as we
have seen, the Faraday rotation is greater for short waves than
for long. The rotation for different coloured light from iron,
nickel, cobalt and magnetite has been measured by Du Bois; in
magnetite the direction of rotation is opposite to that of the
other metals. When the light is incident obliquely and not normally
on the polished pole of an electromagnet, it is elliptically
polarized after reflection, even when the plane of polarization
is parallel or at right angles to the plane of incidence.
According to Righi, the amount of rotation when the plane
of polarization of the incident light is perpendicular to the
plane of incidence reaches a maximum when the angle of
incidence is between 44° and 68°, while when the light is polarized
in the plane of incidence the rotation steadily decreases as
the angle of incidence is increased. The rotation when the light
is polarized in the plane of incidence is always less than when it is
polarized at right angles to that plane, except when the incidence
is normal, when the two rotations are of course equal.</p>

<p><i>Reflection from Tangentially Magnetized Iron.</i>&mdash;In this case
Kerr<a name="fa26c" id="fa26c" href="#ft26c"><span class="sp">26</span></a> found: (1) When the plane of incidence is perpendicular
to the lines of magnetic force, no rotation of the reflected light
is produced by magnetization; (2) no rotation is produced when
the light is incident normally; (3) when the incidence is oblique,
the lines of magnetic force being in the plane of incidence, the
reflected light is elliptically polarized after reflection, and the axes
of the ellipse are not in and at right angles to the plane of incidence.
When the light is polarized in the plane of incidence, the
rotation is at all angles of incidence in the opposite direction to
that of the currents which would produce a magnetic field of the
same sign as the magnet. When the light is polarized at right
angles to the plane of incidence, the rotation is in the same direction
as these currents when the angle of incidence is between 0°
and 75° according to Kerr, between 0° and 80° according to
Kundt, and between 0° and 78° 54&prime; according to Righi. When
the incidence is more oblique than this, the rotation of the
plane of polarization is in the opposite direction to the electric
currents which would produce a magnetic field of the same sign.</p>

for a critical discussion of many of these theories we refer the
reader to Larmor&rsquo;s<a name="fa42c" id="fa42c" href="#ft42c"><span class="sp">42</span></a> British Association Report. Most of these
theories have proceeded on the plan of adding to the expression
for the electromotive force terms indicating a force similar in
character to that discovered by Hall (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Magnetism</a></span>) in metallic
conductors carrying a current in a magnetic field, <i>i.e.</i> an electromotive
force at right angles to the plane containing the magnetic
force and the electric current, and proportional to the sine of the
angle between these vectors. The introduction of a term of
this kind gives rotation of the plane of polarization by transmission
through all refracting substance, and by reflection from
magnetized metals, and shows a fair agreement between the
theoretical and experimental results. The simplest way of
treating the questions seems, however, to be to go to the equations
which represent the propagation of a wave travelling
through a medium containing ions. A moving ion in a magnetic
field will be acted upon by a mechanical force which is at right
angles to its direction of motion, and also to the magnetic force,
and is equal per unit charge to the product of these two vectors
and the sine of the angle between them. For the sake of brevity
we will take the special case of a wave travelling parallel to the
magnetic force in the direction of the axis of <i>z</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Then supposing that all the ions are of the same kind, and that
there are n of these each with mass m and charge e per unit volume,
the equations representing the field are (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Electric Waves</a></span>):&mdash;</p>

For the great majority of substances the direction of rotation is
that corresponding to the negation ion. We see from the equations

this value corresponds to a free period of the ions, so that the

<p><i>Zeeman&rsquo;s Effect.</i>&mdash;Faraday, after discovering the effect of a
magnetic field on the plane of polarization of light, made numerous
experiments to see if such a field influenced the nature of
the light emitted by a luminous body, but without success. In
1885 Fievez,<a name="fa44c" id="fa44c" href="#ft44c"><span class="sp">44</span></a> a Belgian physicist, noticed that the spectrum of a
sodium flame was changed slightly in appearance by a magnetic
field; but his observation does not seem to have attracted much
attention, and was probably ascribed to secondary effects.
In 1896 Zeeman<a name="fa45c" id="fa45c" href="#ft45c"><span class="sp">45</span></a> saw a distinct broadening of the lines of
lithium and sodium when the flames containing salts of these
metals were between the poles of a powerful electromagnet;
following up this observation, he obtained some exceedingly
remarkable and interesting results, of which those observed with
the blue-green cadmium line may be taken as typical. He found
that in a strong magnetic field, when the lines of force are parallel
to the direction of propagation of the light, the line is split up
into a doublet, the constituents of which are on opposite sides
of the undisturbed position of the line, and that the light in the
constituents of this doublet is circularly polarized, the rotation in
the two lines being in opposite directions. When the magnetic
force is at right angles to the direction of propagation of the light,
the line is resolved into a triplet, of which the middle line occupies
the same position as the undisturbed line; all the constituents
of this triplet are plane-polarized, the plane of polarization of
the middle line being at right angles to the magnetic force, while
the outside lines are polarized on a plane parallel to the lines of
magnetic force. A great deal of light is thrown on this phenomenon
by the following considerations due to H. A. Lorentz.<a name="fa46c" id="fa46c" href="#ft46c"><span class="sp">46</span></a></p>

<p class="noind">Thus the motion of the ion on the xy plane may be regarded as
made up of two circular motions in opposite directions described
with frequencies p<span class="su">1</span> and p<span class="su">2</span> respectively, while the motion along z
has the period p, which is the frequency for all the vibrations
when H = 0. Now suppose that the cadmium line is due to the
motion of such an ion; then if the magnetic force is along the
direction of propagation, the vibration in this direction has its
period unaltered, but since the direction of vibration is perpendicular
to the wave front, it does not give rise to light. Thus we
are left with the two circular motions in the wave front with frequencies
p<span class="su">1</span> and p<span class="su">2</span> giving the circularly polarized constituents of
the doublet. Now suppose the magnetic force is at right angles
to the direction of propagation of the light; then the vibration
parallel to the magnetic force being in the wave front produces
luminous effects and gives rise to a plane-polarized ray of undisturbed
period (the middle line of the triplet), the plane of polarization
being at right angles to the magnetic force. The components
in the wave-front of the circular orbits at right angles to the magnetic
force will be rectilinear motions of frequency p<span class="su">1</span> and p<span class="su">2</span> at right
angles to the magnetic force&mdash;so that they will produce plane-polarized
light, the plane of polarization being parallel to the
magnetic force; these are the outer lines of the triplet.</p>
</div>

<p>If Zeeman&rsquo;s observations are interpreted from this point of
view, the directions of rotation of the circularly-polarized light
in the doublet observed along the lines of magnetic force show
that the ions which produce the luminous vibrations are <i>negatively</i>
electrified, while the measurement of the charge of frequency
due to the magnetic field shows that e/m is of the order
10<span class="sp">7</span>. This result is of great interest, as this is the order of the
value of e/m in the negatively electrified particles which constitute
the Cathode Rays (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Conduction, Electric</a></span> III. <i>Through
Gases</i>). Thus we infer that the &ldquo;cathode particles&rdquo; are found in
bodies, even where not subject to the action of intense electrical
fields, and are in fact an ordinary constituent of the molecule.
Similar particles are found near an incandescent wire, and also
near a metal plate illuminated by ultra-violet light. The value
of e/m deduced from the Zeeman effect ranges from 10<span class="sp">7</span> to
3.4 × 10<span class="sp">7</span>, the value of e/m for the particle in the cathode rays is
1.7 × 10<span class="sp">7</span>. The majority of the determinations of e/m from the
Zeeman effect give numbers larger than this, the maximum
being about twice this value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page391" id="page391"></a>391</span></p>

<p>A more extended study of the behaviour of the spectroscopic
lines has afforded examples in which the effects produced by a
magnet are more complicated than those we have described,
indeed the simple cases are much less numerous than the more
complex. Thus Preston<a name="fa47c" id="fa47c" href="#ft47c"><span class="sp">47</span></a> and Cornu<a name="fa48c" id="fa48c" href="#ft48c"><span class="sp">48</span></a> have shown that under
the action of a transverse magnetic field one of the D lines splits
up into four, and the other into six lines; Preston has given
many other examples of these quartets and sextets, and has
shown that the change in the frequency, which, according to
the simple theory indicated, should be the same for all lines,
actually varies considerably from one line to another, many lines
showing no appreciable displacement. The splitting up of a
single line into a quartet or sextet indicates, from the point of
view of the ion theory, that the line must have its origin in a
system consisting of more than one ion. A single ion having
only three degrees of freedom can only have three periods.
When there is no magnetic force acting on the ion these periods
are equal, but though under the action of a magnetic force they
are separated, their number cannot be increased. When therefore
we get four or more lines, the inference is that the system
giving the lines must have at least four degrees of freedom, and
therefore must consist of more than one ion. The theory of a
system of ions mutually influencing each other shows, as we
should expect, that the effects are more complex than in the case
of a single ion, and that the change in the frequency is not
necessarily the same for all systems (see J. J. Thomson, <i>Proc.
Camb. Phil. Soc.</i> 13, p. 39). Preston<a name="fa49c" id="fa49c" href="#ft49c"><span class="sp">49</span></a> and Runge and Paschen
have proved that, in some cases at any rate, the change in the
frequency of the different lines is of such a character that they
can be grouped into series such that each line in the series has
the same change in frequency for the same magnetic force, and,
moreover, that homologous lines in the spectra of different metals
belonging to the same group have the same change in frequency.</p>

<p>A very remarkable case of the Zeeman effect has been discovered
by H. Becquerel and Deslandres (<i>Comptes rendus</i>, 127,
p. 18). They found lines in iron when the most deflected components
are those polarized in the plane at right angles to the
magnetic force. On the simple theory the light polarized in
this way is not affected. Thus the behaviour of the spectrum
in the magnetic field promises to throw great light on the nature
of radiation, and perhaps on the constitution of the elements.
The study of these effects has been greatly facilitated by the
invention by Michelson<a name="fa50c" id="fa50c" href="#ft50c"><span class="sp">50</span></a> of the echelon spectroscope.</p>

<p>There are some interesting phenomena connected with the
Zeeman effect which are more easily observed than the effect
itself. Thus Cotton<a name="fa51c" id="fa51c" href="#ft51c"><span class="sp">51</span></a> found that if we have two Bunsen flames,
A and B, coloured by the same salt, the absorption of the light
of one by the other is diminished if either is placed between the
poles of a magnet: this is at once explained by the Zeeman effect,
for the times of vibration of the molecules of the flame in the
magnetic field are not the same as those of the other flame,
and thus the absorption is diminished. Similar considerations
explain the phenomenon observed by Egoroff and Georgiewsky,<a name="fa52c" id="fa52c" href="#ft52c"><span class="sp">52</span></a>
that the light emitted from a flame in a transverse field is partially
polarized in a plane parallel to the magnetic force; and also
Righi&rsquo;s<a name="fa53c" id="fa53c" href="#ft53c"><span class="sp">53</span></a> observation that if a sodium flame is placed in a longitudinal
field between two crossed Nicols, and a ray of white light
sent through one of the Nicols, then through the flame, and then
through the second Nicol, the amount of light passing through
the second Nicol is greater when the field is on than when it is off.
Voight and Wiechert (<i>Wied. Ann.</i> 67, p. 345) detected the double
refraction produced when light travels through a substance
exposed to a magnetic field at right angles to the path of the
light; this result had been predicted by Voight from theoretical
considerations. Jean Becquerel has made some very interesting
experiments on the effect of a magnetic field on the fine absorption
bands produced by xenotime, a phosphate of yttrium and
erbium, and tysonite, a fluoride of cerium, lanthanum and
didymium, and has obtained effects which he ascribes to the
presence of positive electrons. A very complete account of
magneto- and electro-optics is contained in Voight&rsquo;s <i>Magneto- and
Elektro-optik</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAGNOLIA,<a name="ar5" id="ar5"></a></span> the typical genus of the botanical order Magnoliaceae,
named after Pierre Magnol (1638-1715), professor of
medicine and botany at Montpellier. It contains about twenty
species, distributed in Japan, China and the Himalayas, as well
as in North America.</p>

<p>Magnolias are trees or shrubs with deciduous or rarely evergreen
foliage. They bear conspicuous and often large, fragrant, white,
rose or purple flowers. The sepals are three in number, the petals
six to twelve, in two to four series of three in each, the stamens
and carpels being numerous. The fruit consists of a number of
follicles which are borne on a more or less conical receptacle, and
dehisce along the outer edge to allow the scarlet or brown seeds
to escape; the seeds however remain suspended by a long slender
thread (the funicle). Of the old-world species, the earliest in
cultivation appears to have been <i>M. Yulan</i> (or <i>M. conspicua</i>) of
China, of which the buds were preserved, as well as used medicinally
and to season rice; together with the greenhouse species,
<i>M. fuscata</i>, it was transported to Europe in 1789, and thence to
North America, and is now cultivated in the Middle States.
There are many fine forms of <i>M. conspicua</i>, the best being
<i>Soulangeana</i>, white tinted with purple, <i>Lenné</i> and <i>stricta</i>. Of the
Japanese magnolias, <i>M. Kobus</i> and the purple-flowered <i>M.
obovata</i> were met with by Kaempfer in 1690, and were introduced
into England in 1709 and 1804 respectively. <i>M. pumila</i>, the
dwarf magnolia, from the mountains of Amboyna, is nearly
evergreen, and bears deliciously scented flowers; it was introduced
in 1786. The Indian species are three in number, <i>M.
globosa</i>, allied to <i>M. conspicua</i> of Japan, <i>M. sphenocarpa</i>, and,
the most magnificent of all magnolias, <i>M. Campbellii</i>, which
forms a conspicuous feature in the scenery and vegetation of
Darjeeling. It was discovered by Dr Griffith in Bhutan, and
is a large forest tree, abounding on the outer ranges of Sikkim,
80 to 150 ft. high, and from 6 to 12 ft. in girth. The flowers
are 6 to 10 in. across, appearing before the leaves, and vary
from white to a deep rose colour.</p>

<p class="pt2">The first of the American species brought to Europe (in 1688
by John Banister) was <i>M. glauca</i>, a beautiful evergreen species
about 15 ft. high with obtuse leathery leaves, blue-green above,
silvery underneath, and globular flowers varying from creamy
white to pale yellow with age. It is found in low situations
near the sea from Massachusetts to Louisiana&mdash;more especially
in New Jersey and the Carolinas. <i>M. acuminata</i>, the so-called
&ldquo;cucumber tree,&rdquo; from the resemblance of the young fruits to
small cucumbers, ranges from Pennsylvania to Carolina. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page392" id="page392"></a>392</span>
wood is yellow, and used for bowls; the flowers, 3 to 4 in. across,
are glaucous green tinted with yellow. It was introduced into
England from Virginia about 1736. <i>M. tripetala</i> (or <i>M. umbrella</i>),
is known as the &ldquo;umbrella tree&rdquo; from the arrangement
of the leaves at the ends of the branches resembling somewhat
that of the ribs of an umbrella. The flowers, 5 to 8 in. across, are
white and have a strong but not disagreeable scent. It was
brought to England in 1752. <i>M. Fraseri</i> (or <i>M. auriculata</i>),
discovered by John Bartram in 1773, is a native of the
western parts of the Carolinas and Georgia, extending southward
to western Florida and southern Alabama. It grows 30 to
50 ft. high, has leaves a foot or more long, heart-shaped and
bluntly auricled at the base, and fragrant pale yellowish-white
flowers, 3 to 4 in. across. The most beautiful species
of North America is <i>M. grandiflora</i>, the &ldquo;laurel magnolia,&rdquo;
a native of the south-eastern States, and introduced into
England in 1734. It grows a straight trunk, 2 ft. in diameter and
upwards of 70 ft. high, bearing a profusion of large, powerfully
lemon-scented creamy-white flowers. It is an evergreen tree,
easily recognized by its glossy green oval oblong leaves with a
rusty-brown under surface. In England it is customary to train
it against a wall in the colder parts, but it does well as a bush tree;
and the original species is surpassed by the Exmouth varieties,
which originated as seedlings at Exeter from the tree first raised
in England by Sir John Colliton, and which flower much more
freely than the parent plant. Other fine magnolias now to be
met with in gardens are <i>M. cordata</i>, a North American deciduous
tree 40 to 50 ft. high, with heart-shaped leaves, woolly beneath,
and yellow flowers lined with purple; <i>M. hypoleuca</i>, a fine
Japanese tree 60 ft. high or more, with leaves a foot or more
long, 6 to 7 in. broad, the under surface covered with hairs;
<i>M. macrophylla</i>, a handsome deciduous North American tree,
with smooth whitish bark, and very large beautiful green
leaves, 1 to 3 ft. long, 8 to 10 in. broad, oblong-obovate and
heart-shaped at the base; the open sweet-scented bell-shaped
flowers 8 to 10 in. across, are white with a purple blotch at
the base of the petals; <i>M. stellata</i> or <i>Halleana</i>, a charming
deciduous Japanese shrub remarkable for producing its pure
white starry flowers as early as February and March on the
leafless stems; and <i>M. Watsoni</i>, another fine deciduous Japanese
bush or small tree with very fragrant pure white flowers 5 to
6 in. across.</p>

<p>The tulip tree, <i>Liriodendron tulipifera</i>, a native of North
America, frequently cultivated in England, is also a member of
the same family. It reaches a height of over 100 ft. in a native
condition, and as much as 60 to 80 ft. in England. It resembles
the plane tree somewhat in appearance, but is readily recognized
by lobed leaves having the apical lobe truncated, and by its
soft green and yellow tulip-like flowers&mdash;which however are rarely
borne on trees under twenty years of age.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAGNUS, HEINRICH GUSTAV<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> (1802-1870), German chemist
and physicist, was born at Berlin on the 2nd of May 1802. His
father was a wealthy merchant; and of his five brothers one,
Eduard (1799-1872), became a celebrated painter. After studying
at Berlin, he went to Stockholm to work under Berzelius, and
later to Paris, where he studied for a while under Gay-Lussac and
Thénard. In 1831 he returned to Berlin as lecturer on technology
and physics at the university. As a teacher his success was rapid
and extraordinary. His lucid style and the perfection of his
experimental demonstrations drew to his lectures a crowd of
enthusiastic scholars, on whom he impressed the importance of
applied science by conducting them round the factories and workshops
of the city; and he further found time to hold weekly
&ldquo;colloquies&rdquo; on physical questions at his house with a small
circle of young students. From 1827 to 1833 he was occupied
mainly with chemical researches, which resulted in the discovery
of the first of the platino-ammonium compounds (&ldquo;Magnus&rsquo;s
green salt&rdquo; is <span class="correction" title="amended from Ptll">PtCl</span><span class="su">2</span>, 2NH<span class="su">3</span>), of sulphovinic, ethionic and isethionic
acids and their salts, and, in conjunction with C. F. Ammermüller,
of periodic acid. Among other subjects at which he subsequently
worked were the absorption of gases in blood (1837-1845), the
expansion of gases by heat (1841-1844), the vapour pressures of
water and various solutions (1844-1854), thermo-electricity
(1851), electrolysis (1856), induction of currents (1858-1861),
conduction of heat in gases (1860), and polarization of heat (1866-1868).
From 1861 onwards he devoted much attention to the
question of diathermancy in gases and vapours, especially to the
behaviour in this respect of dry and moist air, and to the thermal
effects produced by the condensation of moisture on solid
surfaces.</p>

<p>In 1834 Magnus was elected extraordinary, and in 1845
ordinary professor at Berlin. He was three times elected dean
of the faculty, in 1847, 1858 and 1863; and in 1861, rector
magnificus. His great reputation led to his being entrusted by
the government with several missions; in 1865 he represented
Prussia in the conference called at Frankfort to introduce a
uniform metric system of weights and measures into Germany.
For forty-five years his labour was incessant; his first memoir was
published in 1825 when he was yet a student; his last appeared
shortly after his death on the 4th of April 1870. He married in
1840 Bertha Humblot, of a French Huguenot family settled in
Berlin, by whom he left a son and two daughters.</p>

French heraldic writer, was born in Paris. After being employed
for some time in the postal service, he devoted himself to the
study of heraldry and genealogy, his work in this direction being
rewarded by Pope Gregory XVI. with a marquisate. He
founded a French college of heraldry, and wrote several works on
heraldry and genealogy, of which the most important were
<i>Archives nobiliaires universelles</i> (1843) and <i>Livre d&rsquo;or de la
noblesse de France</i> (1844-1852). His two sons, Edouard Drigon
and Achille Ludovice Drigon, respectively comte and vicomte
de Magny, also wrote several works on heraldry.</p>

founder of the military power of Carthage, fl. 550-500 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
(Justin xviii. 7, xix. i). (2) The youngest of the three sons of
Hamilcar Barca. He accompanied Hannibal into Italy, and
held important commands in the great victories of the first three
years. After the battle of Cannae (216 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) he sailed to Carthage
to report the successes gained. He was about to return to Italy
with strong reinforcements for Hannibal, when the government
ordered him to go to the aid of his other brother, Hasdrubal, who
was hard pressed in Spain. He carried on the war there with
varying success in concert with the two Hasdrubals until, in 209,
his brother marched into Italy to help Hannibal. Mago remained
in Spain with Hasdrubal, the son of Gisco. In 207 he was
defeated by M. Junius Silanus, and in 206 the combined forces of
Mago and Hasdrubal were scattered by Scipio Africanus in the
decisive battle of Silpia. Mago maintained himself for some time
in Gades, but afterwards received orders to carry the war into
Liguria. He wintered in the Balearic Isles, where the harbour
Portus Magonis (Port Mahon) still bears his name. Early in
204 he landed in Liguria, where he maintained a desultory
warfare till in 203 he was defeated in Cisalpine Gaul by the
Roman forces. Shortly afterwards he was ordered to return to
Carthage, but on the voyage home he died of wounds received
in battle.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAGPIE,<a name="ar9" id="ar9"></a></span> or simply <span class="sc">Pie</span> (Fr. <i>pie</i>), the prefix being the abbreviated
form of a human name (Margaret<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a>), a bird once common
throughout Great Britain, though now nearly everywhere scarce.
Its pilfering habits have led to this result, yet the injuries it
causes are exaggerated by common report; and in many countries
of Europe it is still the tolerated or even the cherished neighbour
of every farmer, as it formerly was in England if not in Scotland
also. It did not exist in Ireland in 1617, when Fynes Morison
wrote his <i>Itinerary</i>, but it had appeared there within a hundred
years later, when Swift mentions its occurrences in his <i>Journal to
Stella</i>, 9th July 1711. It is now common enough in that country,
and there is a widespread but unfounded belief that it was introduced
by the English out of spite. It is a species that when
not molested is extending its range, as J. Wolley ascertained in
Lapland, where within the last century it has been gradually
pushing its way along the coast and into the interior from one
fishing-station or settler&rsquo;s house to the next, as the country has
been peopled.</p>

<p>Since the persecution to which the pie has been subjected in
Great Britain, its habits have altered greatly. It is no longer
the merry, saucy hanger-on of the homestead, but is become
the suspicious thief, shunning the gaze of man, and knowing that
danger may lurk in every bush. Hence opportunities of observing
it fall to the lot of few, and most persons know it only as a
curtailed captive in a wicker cage, where its vivacity and natural
beauty are lessened or wholly lost. At large few European birds
possess greater beauty, the pure white of its scapulars and inner
web of the flight-feathers contrasting vividly with the deep glossy
black on the rest of its body and wings, while its long tail is
lustrous with green, bronze, and purple reflections. The pie&rsquo;s
nest is a wonderfully ingenious structure, placed either in high
trees or low bushes, and so massively built that it will stand for
years. Its foundation consists of stout sticks, turf and clay,
wrought into a deep, hollow cup, plastered with earth, and lined
with fibres; but around this is erected a firmly interwoven,
basket-like outwork of thorny sticks, forming a dome over the
nest, and leaving but a single hole in the side for entrance and
exit, so that the whole structure is rendered almost impregnable.
Herein are laid from six to nine eggs, of a pale bluish-green
freckled with brown and blotched with ash-colour. Superstition
as to the appearance of the pie still survives even among many
educated persons, and there are several versions of a rhyming
adage as to the various turns of luck which its presenting itself,
either alone or in company with others, is supposed to betoken,
though all agree that the sight of a single pie presages sorrow.</p>

<p>The pie belongs to the same family of birds as the crow, and is
the <i>Corvus pica</i> of Linnaeus, the <i>Pica caudata</i>, <i>P. melanoleuca</i>, or
<i>P. rustica</i> of modern ornithologists, who have recognized it as
forming a distinct genus, but the number of species thereto
belonging has been a fruitful source of discussion. Examples
from the south of Spain differ slightly from those inhabiting the
rest of Europe, and in some points more resemble the <i>P. mauritanica</i>
of north-western Africa; but that species has a patch of
bare skin of a fine blue colour behind the eye, and much shorter
wings. No fewer than five species have been discriminated from
various parts of Asia, extending to Japan; but only one of them,
the <i>P. leucoptera</i> of Turkestan and Tibet, has of late been
admitted as valid. In the west of North America, and in some
of its islands, a pie is found which extends to the upper valleys
of the Missouri and the Yellowstone, and has long been thought
entitled to specific distinction as <i>P. hudsonia</i>; but its claim
thereto is now disallowed by some of the best ornithologists
of the United States, and it can hardly be deemed even a
geographical variety of the Old-World form. In California,
however, there is a permanent race if not a good species,
<i>P. nuttalli</i>, easily distinguishable by its yellow bill and the bare
yellow skin round its eyes; on two occasions in the year 1867 a
bird apparently similar was observed in Great Britain (<i>Zoologist</i>,
ser. 2, pp. 706, 1016).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAGWE,<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span> a district in the Minbu division of Upper Burma.
Area, 2913 sq. m.; pop. (1901), 246,708, showing an increase
of 12.38% in the decade. Magwe may be divided into two
portions: the low, flat country in the Taungdwingyi subdivision,
and the undulating high ground extending over the rest of the
district. In Taungdwingyi the soil is rich, loamy, and extremely
fertile. The plain is about 45 m. from north to south. At its
southern extremity it is about 30 m. wide, and lessens in width
to the north till it ends in a point at Natmauk. On the east are
the Pegu Yomas, which at some points reach a height of 1500 ft.
A number of streams run westwards to the Irrawaddy, of which
the Yin and the Pin, which form the northern boundary, are the
chief. The only perennial stream is the Yanpè. Rice is the
staple product, and considerable quantities are exported. Sesamum
of very high quality, maize, and millet are also cultivated,
as well as cotton in patches here and there over the whole
district.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In this district are included the well-known Yenangyaung petroleum
wells. The state wells have been leased to the Burma Oil
Company. The amount of oil-bearing lands is estimated at 80 sq. m.
and the portion not leased to the company has been demarcated
into blocks of 1 sq. m. and offered on lease. The remaining land
belongs to hereditary Burmese owners called <i>twinsa</i>, who dig wells
and extract their oil by the rope and pulley system as they have
always done. Lacquered wood trays, bowls and platters, and cart-wheels,
are the only manufactures of any note in the district.</p>

<p>The annual rainfall averages about 27 inches. The maximum
temperature rises to a little over 100° in the hot season, and falls
to an average minimum of 53° and 54° in the cold season.</p>

<p>The town of Magwe is the headquarters of the district; pop.
(1901), 6232. It is diagonally opposite Minbu, the headquarters
of the division, on the right bank of the Irrawaddy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAGYARS,<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span> the name of the dominant race in Hungary, or
Hungarians proper. Though they have become physically
assimilated to the western peoples, they belong in origin and
language to the Finno-Ugrian (<i>q.v.</i>) division of the Ural-Altaic
race. They form barely half of the population of Hungary, but
are by far the largest and most compact of all its racial groups.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>394</span>
Magyar is the official language of Hungary, the official name of
which (<i>Magyarorzág</i>, or &ldquo;country of the Magyars&rdquo;) enshrines
the Magyar claim to predominance. While all Magyars are
properly Hungarians, all Hungarians are not necessarily Magyars.
&ldquo;Hungarian&rdquo; may be used as a generic term covering
all the various races of Hungary, while &ldquo;Magyar&rdquo; is strictly
specific to a single group. The Magyars themselves, indeed,
sometimes apply the name <i>Magyarorzág</i> to Hungary &ldquo;proper,&rdquo;
excluding Croatia-Slavonia, the whole kingdom being called
<i>Magyarbirodalom</i>, the Magyar monarchy or realm. See

<p><span class="bold">MAHABALESHWAR,<a name="ar12" id="ar12"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Malcolmpeth</span>, a hill station in
Satara district, and the principal sanatorium in the Bombay
presidency, India. Pop. (1901), 5299. It is reached by
carriage from Wathar railway station (39 m.) or by motor car
from Poona (119 m.). Mahabaleshwar occupies the summit
of a ridge of the Western Ghats, with a general elevation of
4500 ft. above sea-level. It was established in 1828 by Sir
John Malcolm, governor of Bombay, who obtained the site from
the raja of Satara in exchange for another patch of territory.
The superior elevation of Mahabaleshwar renders it much cooler
than Matheran (2460 ft.), a sanatorium about 50 m. E. of
Bombay, but its heavy rainfall (292 in. annual average) makes
it almost uninhabitable during the rainy season. The mean
annual temperature is 67° F. In the hottest season (March-April)
an extreme of a little over 90° is reached during the
day. Mahabaleshwar forms the retreat usually during spring,
and occasionally in autumn, of the governor of Bombay, and the
chief officers of his establishment, and has the usual public
buildings of a first-class sanatorium.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAHAFFY, JOHN PENTLAND<a name="ar13" id="ar13"></a></span> (1839-&emsp;&emsp;), Irish classical
scholar, was born in Switzerland on the 12th of July 1839. He
received his early education in Switzerland and Germany, and
later at Trinity College, Dublin, where he held the professorship
of ancient history. Mahaffy, a man of great versatility, published
numerous works, some of which, especially those dealing with
what may be called the Silver age of Greece, became standard
authorities. The following deserve mention: <i>History of Classical
Greek Literature</i> (4th ed., 1903 seq.); <i>Social Life in Greece from
Homer to Menander</i> (4th ed., 1903); <i>The Silver Age of the Greek
World</i> (1906); <i>The Empire of the Ptolemies</i> (1896); <i>Greek Life and
Thought from Alexander to the Roman Conquest</i> (2nd ed., 1896);
<i>The Greek World under Roman Sway from Polybius to Plutarch</i>
(1890). His translation of Kuno Fischer&rsquo;s <i>Commentary on Kant</i>
(1866) and his own exhaustive analysis, with elucidations, of
Kant&rsquo;s critical philosophy are of great value. He also edited the
Petrie papyri in the <i>Cunningham Memoirs</i> (3 vols. 1891-1905).</p>

(the other four being Irak, Ferahan, Kezzaz, and Savah), which
were under a governor appointed by the shah; since then it has
formed part of the Isfahan government. It is traversed by the
Anarbar or Kum River, and comprises the city of Mahallat,
divided into upper and lower, or Rivkan and Zanjirvan, and
twenty-two flourishing villages. It was known in former times
as Anar, the Anarus of Peutinger&rsquo;s tables. The city, capital of

<p><span class="bold">MAHAN, ALFRED THAYER<a name="ar15" id="ar15"></a></span> (1840-&emsp;&emsp;), American naval
officer and historian, was born on the 27th of September 1840
at West Point, New York. His father, Dennis Hart Mahan
(1802-1871) was a professor in the military academy, and the
author of textbooks on civil and military engineering. The son
graduated at the naval academy in 1859, became lieutenant in
1861, served on the &ldquo;Congress,&rdquo; and on the &ldquo;Pocahontas,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Seminole,&rdquo; and &ldquo;James Adger&rdquo; during the Civil War, and was
instructor at the naval academy for a year. In 1865 he was made
lieut.-commander, commander in 1872, captain in 1885. Meanwhile
he saw service in the Gulf of Mexico, the South Atlantic, the
Pacific, and Asia, and did shore duty at Boston, New York and
Annapolis. In 1886-89 he was president of the naval war college at
Newport, Rhode Island. Between 1889 and 1892 he was
engaged in special service for the bureau of navigation, and in
1893 was made commander of the &ldquo;Chicago,&rdquo; of the European
squadron. In 1896 he retired from active service, but was a
member of the naval board of strategy during the war between
the United States and Spain. He was a member of the peace
congress at the Hague in 1899. This long and varied service
gave him extensive opportunities for observation, which he supplemented
by constant study of naval authorities and reflection
on the interpretation of the problems of maritime history. His
first book was a modest and compact story of the affairs in <i>The
Gulf and Inland Waters</i> (1883), in a series of volumes by various
writers, entitled <i>The Navy in the Civil War</i>; in 1890 he suddenly
acquired fame by the appearance of his masterly work entitled
<i>The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660-1783</i>. Having
been impressed by the failure of historians to allow for the influence
of sea power in struggles between nations, he was led to
make prolonged investigations of this general theme (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sea
Power</a></span>). The reception accorded the volume was instant and
hearty; in England, in particular, it was deemed almost an epoch-making
work, and was studied by naval specialists, cabinet
ministers and journalists, as well as by a large part of the general
public. It was followed by <i>The Influence of Sea Power upon the
French Revolution and Empire</i> (2 vols. 1892); <i>The Life of Nelson,
the Embodiment of the Sea Power of Great Britain</i> (1897); and <i>Sea
Power in its Relations to the War of 1812</i> (1905). The author&rsquo;s
general aim in these works&mdash;some of which have been translated
into French, German and Japanese&mdash;was to make the consideration
of maritime matters paramount to that of military, political
or economic movements, without, however, as he himself says
&ldquo;divorcing them from their surroundings of cause and effect in
general history, but seeking to show how they modified the latter,
and were modified by them.&rdquo; He selected the year 1660 as the
beginning of his narrative, as being the date when the &ldquo;sailing-ship
era, with its distinctive features, had fairly begun.&rdquo; The
series as a whole has been accepted as finally authoritative, supplanting
its predecessors of similar aim, and almost&mdash;in the
words of Theodore Roosevelt&mdash;founding a new school of naval
historical writing.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAHANADI,<a name="ar16" id="ar16"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Mahanuddy</span> (&ldquo;The Great River&rdquo;), a river
of India. It rises in 20° 10&prime; N., 82° E., 25 m. S. of Raipur
town, in the wild mountains of Bastar in the Central Provinces.
At first an insignificant stream, taking a northerly direction,
it drains the eastern portion of the Chhattisgarh plain, then
a little above Seorinarayan it receives the waters which its
first great affluent, the Seonath, has collected from the western
portion of the plain; thence flowing for some distance due
E., its stream is augmented by the drainage of the hills of
Uprora, Korba, and the ranges that separate Sambalpur from
Chota Nagpur. At Padampur it turns towards the south,
and struggling through masses of rock, flows past the town of
Sambalpur to Sonpur. From Sonpur it pursues a tortuous
course among ridges and rocky crags towards the range of
the Eastern Ghats. This mountain line it pierces by a gorge
about 40 m. in length, overlooked by forest-clad hills. Since
the opening of the Bengal-Nagpur railway, the Mahanadi
is little used for navigation. It pours down upon the Orissa
delta at Naraj, about 7 m. west of Cuttack town; and after
traversing Cuttack district from west to east, and throwing off
numerous branches (the Katjori, Paika, Biropa, Chitartala,
&amp;c.) it falls into the Bay of Bengal at False Point by several
channels.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Mahanadi has an estimated drainage area of 43,800 sq. m.,
and its rapid flow renders its maximum discharge in time of flood
second to that of no other river in India. During unusually high
floods 1,500,000 cub. ft. of water pour every second through the
Naraj gorge, one-half of which, uncontrolled by the elaborate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>395</span>
embankments, and heavily laden with silt, pours over the delta,
filling the swamps, inundating the rice-fields, and converting the
plains into a sea. In the dry weather the discharge of the Mahanadi
dwindles to 1125 cub. ft. per second. Efforts have been made to
husband and utilize the vast water supply thrown upon the Orissa
delta during seasons of flood. Each of the three branches into
which the parent stream splits at the delta head is regulated by a
weir. Of the four canals which form the Orissa irrigation system,
two take off from the Biropa weir, and one, with its branch, from
the Mahanadi weir. On the 31st of December 1868 the government
took over the whole canal works from the East Indian Irrigation
Company, at a cost of £941,368. The canals thus taken over and
since completed, are the high-level canal, the Kendrapara canal,
the Taldanda canal and the Machgaon canal, irrigating 275,000
acres.</p>

from the 5th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> to the middle of the 5th century
<span class="scs">A.D.</span>, written in Pali verse by Mah&#257;n&#257;ma of the D&#299;ghasanda
Hermitage, shortly after the close of the period with which
it deals. In point of historical value it compares well with
early European chronicles. In India proper the decipherment
of early Indian inscriptions was facilitated to a very great
extent by the data found only in the Mah&#257;va&#7747;sa. It was
composed on the basis of earlier works written in Sinhalese,
which are now lost, having been supplanted by the chronicles
and commentaries in which their contents were restated in
Pali in the course of the 5th century. The particular one
on which our Mah&#257;va&#7747;sa was mainly based was also called
the Mah&#257;va&#7747;sa, and was written in Sinhalese prose with Pali
memorial verse interspersed. The extant Pali work gives
legends of the Buddha and the genealogy of his family; a sketch
of the history of India down to Asoka; an account of Buddhism
in India down to the same date; a description of the sending
out of missionaries after Asoka&rsquo;s council, and especially of
the mission of Mahinda to Ceylon; a sketch of the previous
history of Ceylon; a long account of the reign of Dev&#257;nam-piya
Tissa, the king of Ceylon who received Mahinda, and established
Buddhism in the island; short accounts of the kings
succeeding him down to Du&#7789;&#7789;ha G&#257;m&#299;in (Dadagamana or
Dutegemunu); then a long account, amounting to an epic
poem, of the adventures and reign of that prince, a popular
hero, born in adversity, who roused the people, and drove
the Tamil invaders out of the island. Finally we have short
notices of the subsequent kings down to the author&rsquo;s time.
The Mah&#257;va&#7747;sa was the first Pali book made known to Europe.
It was edited in 1837, with English translation and an elaborate
introduction, by George Turnour, then colonial secretary
in Ceylon. Its vocabulary was an important part of the material
utilized in Childer&rsquo;s <i>Pali Dictionary</i>. Its relation to the sources
from which it drew has been carefully discussed by various
scholars and in especial detail by Geiger. It is agreed that
it gives a reasonably fair and correct presentation of the tradition
preserved in the lost Sinhalese Mah&#257;va&#7747;sa; that, except
in the earliest period, its list of kings, with the years of each
reign, is complete and trustworthy; and that it gives throughout
the view, as to events in Ceylon, of a resident in the Great
Minster at Anur&#257;dhapura.</p>

later Buddhism, the popular religion which embraced all the
people and had its pantheon of Buddhas and Bodhisatvas,
with attendant deities and demons, spacious temples and
images, pompous ceremonial and noisy festivals. It was
thus contrasted with the Hinayana (&ldquo;Little Vehicle&rdquo;) of

<p><span class="bold">MAHDI<a name="ar22" id="ar22"></a></span> (Arab. &ldquo;he who is guided aright&rdquo;), a title assumed
by the third Abbasid caliph (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Caliphate</a></span>: <i>Abbasids</i>, § 3).
According to Moslem traditionists Mahomet declared that
one of his descendants, the imam of God, who would fill the
earth with equity and justice, would bear the name of al-mahdi.
The Sunnis hold that this mahdi has not yet appeared. The
name of mahdi is also given by the Shi&rsquo;ite Mahommedans
to the last of the imams of the house of &lsquo;Ali. It was under
the name of al-mahdi that Mokhtar proclaimed &lsquo;Ali&rsquo;s son
Mahommed as the opponent of the caliph Abdalmalik, and,
according to Shahrastani, the doctrine of the mahdi, the hidden
deliverer who is one day to appear and fill the oppressed world
with righteousness, first arose in connexion with a belief that
this Mahommed had not died but lived concealed at Mount
Radw&#257;, near Mecca, guarded by a lion and a panther. The
hidden imam of the common Shi&lsquo;ites is, however, the twelfth
imam, Mahommed Abu&lsquo;I-Qasim, who disappeared mysteriously
in 879. The belief in the appearance of the mahdi readily
lent itself to imposture. Of the many pretenders to this dignity
known in all periods of Moslem history the most famous was
the first caliph of the Fatimite dynasty in North Africa, &lsquo;Obaidallah
al-Mahdi, who reigned 909-933. After him was named
the first capital of the dynasty, the once important city of
Mahdia (<i>q.v.</i>). Another great historical movement, headed
by a leader who proclaimed himself the mahdi (Mahommed
ibn Abdallah ibn Tumart), was that of the Almohades (<i>q.v.</i>).
In 1881 Mahommed Ahmed ibn Seyyid Abdullah (<i>q.v.</i>), a
Dongolese, proclaimed himself al-mahdi and founded in the
eastern Sudan the short-lived empire overthrown by an Anglo-Egyptian
force at the battle of Omdurman in 1898. Concurrently
with the claim of Mahommed Ahmed to be the
mahdi the same title was claimed by, or for, the head of the
Senussites, a confraternity powerful in many regions of North
Africa.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAHDIA<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span> (also spelt <i>Mehdia</i>, <i>Mehedia</i>, &amp;c.), a town of Tunisia,
on the coast between the gulfs of Hammamet and Gabes, 47 m.
by rail S.S.E. of Susa. Pop. about 8000. Mahdia is built
on a rocky peninsula which projects eastward about a mile
beyond the normal coast line, and is not more than a quarter
of a mile wide. The extremity of the peninsula is called Ras
Mahdia or Cape Africa&mdash;Africa being the name by which
Mahdia was designated by Froissart and other European
historians during the middle ages and the Renaissance. In
the centre of the peninsula and occupying its highest point
is a citadel (16th century); another castle farther west is now
used as a prison and is in the centre of the native town. The
European quarter and the new port are on the south-west side of
the peninsula. The port is available for small boats only;
steamers anchor in the roadstead about a quarter of a mile from
the shore. On the south-east, cut out of the rock, is the ancient
harbour, or <i>cothon</i>, measuring about 480 ft by 240 ft., the
entrance being 42 ft. wide. There are manufactories of olive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page396" id="page396"></a>396</span>
oil, but the chief industry is sardine fishing, largely in the
hands of Italians.</p>

<p>Mahdia occupies the site of a Phoenician settlement and
by some authorities is identified with the town called Turris
Hannibalis by the Romans. Hannibal is said to have embarked
here on his exile from Carthage. After the Arab conquest
of North Africa the town fell into decay. It was refounded
in 912 by the first Fatimite caliph, &lsquo;Obaidallah-al-Mahdi,
after whom it was named. It became the port of Kairawan
and was for centuries a city of considerable importance, largely
owing to its great natural strength, and its position on the
Mediterranean. It carried on an active trade with Egypt,
Syria and Spain. The town was occupied by the Normans
of Sicily in the 12th century, but after holding it for about
twelve years they were driven out in 1159 by the Almohades.
In 1390 a joint English and French force vainly besieged Mahdia
for sixty-one days. In the early part of the 16th century the
corsair Dragut seized the town and made it his capital, but
in 1550 the place was captured by the Spaniards, who held
it until 1574. Before evacuating the town the Spaniards
dismantled the fortifications. Under the rule of the Turks
and, later, the beys of Tunis Mahdia became a place of little
importance. It was occupied by the French in 1881 without
opposition, and regained some of its former commercial importance.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAHMUD I.<a name="ar28" id="ar28"></a></span> (1696-1754), sultan of Turkey, was the son of
Mustafa II., and succeeded his uncle Ahmed III. in 1730. After
the suppression of a military revolt the war with Persia was
continued with varying success, and terminated in 1736 by
a treaty of peace restoring the <i>status quo ante bellum</i>. The
next enemy whom Turkey was called upon to face was Russia,
later joined by Austria. War went on for four years; the
successes gained by Russia were outweighed by Austria&rsquo;s
various reverses, terminating by the defeat of Wallis at Krotzka,
and the peace concluded at Belgrade was a triumph for Turkish
diplomacy. The sultan, throughout desirous for peace, is
said to have been much under the influence of the chief eunuch,
Haji Beshir Aga. In 1754 Mahmud died of heart-disease
when returning from the Friday service at the mosque. He
had a passion for building, to which are due numberless
kiosques, where nocturnal orgies were carried on by him and
his boon companions. In this reign the system of appointing
Phanariote Greeks to the principalities of Moldavia and
Wallachia was instituted. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Phanariotes</a></span>.)</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">MAHMUD II.<a name="ar29" id="ar29"></a></span> (1785-1839), sultan of Turkey, was the son
of Abu-ul-Hamid I., and succeeded his brother, Mustafa IV.,
in 1808. He had shared the captivity of his ill-fated cousin,
the ex-sultan, Selim III., whose efforts at reform had ended
in his deposition by the janissaries. Mahm&#363;d was thus early
impressed with the necessity for dissembling his intention to
institute reforms until he should be powerful enough to carry
them through. The reforming efforts of the grand vizier
Bairakdar, to whom he had owed his life and his accession,
broke on the opposition of the janissaries; and Mahmud had
to wait for more favourable times. Meanwhile the empire
seemed in danger of breaking up. Not till 1812 was the war
with Russia closed by the treaty of Bucharest, which restored
Moldavia and the greater part of Wallachia to the Ottoman
government. But though the war was ended, the terms of the
treaty left a number of burning questions, both internal and
external, unsettled. This was notably the case with the claim
of Russia to Poti and the valley of the Rion (Phasis), which was
still outstanding at the time of the congress of Vienna (1814-1815)
and prevented the question of a European guarantee of
the integrity of Turkey from being considered.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, within the empire, ambitious valis were one by
one attempting to carve out dominions for themselves at the
expense of the central power. The ambitions of Mehemet Ali
of Egypt were not yet fully revealed; but Ali (<i>q.v.</i>) of Jannina,
who had marched to the aid of the sultan against the rebellious
pasha Pasvan Oglu of Widdin, soon began to show his hand,
and it needed the concentration of all the forces of the Turkish
empire to effect his overthrow and death (1822). The preoccupation
of the sultan with Ali gave their opportunity to
the Greeks whose disaffection had long been organized in the
great secret society of the <i>Hetaeria Philike</i>, against which
Metternich had in vain warned the Ottoman government.
In 1821 occurred the abortive raid of Alexander Ypsilanti
into the Danubian principalities, and in May of the same year
the revolt of the Greeks of the Morea began the war of Greek
Independence (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Greece</a></span>: <i>History</i>). The rising in the north
was easily crushed; but in the south the Ottoman power was
hampered by the defection of the sea-faring Greeks, by whom
the Turkish navy had hitherto been manned. After three
abortive campaigns Mahmud was compelled, infinitely against
his will, to summon to his assistance the already too powerful
pasha of Egypt, Mehemet Ali, whom he had already employed
to suppress the rebellious Wahhabis in Arabia. The disciplined
Egyptian army, supported by a well organized fleet, rapidly
accomplished what the Turks had failed to do; and by 1826
the Greeks were practically subdued on land, and Ibrahim
was preparing to turn his attention to the islands. But for
the intervention of the powers and the battle of Navarino
Mahmud&rsquo;s authority would have been restored in Greece.
The news of Navarino betrayed Mahmud into one of those
paroxysms of rage to which he was liable, and which on critical
occasions were apt fatally to cloud his usual good sense. After
in vain attempting to obtain an apology for &ldquo;the unparalleled
outrage against a friendly power&rdquo; he issued on the 20th of
December a solemn <i>hatti sheriff</i> summoning the faithful to a
holy war. This, together with certain outstanding grievances
and the pretext of enforcing the settlement of the Greek Question
approved by the powers, gave Russia the excuse for declaring
war against Turkey. After two hardly fought campaigns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>397</span>
(1828, 1829) Mahmud was at length, on the 14th of September
1829, compelled to sign the peace of Adrianople. From this
moment until his death Mahmud was, to all intents and purposes,
the &ldquo;vassal of Russia,&rdquo; though not without occasional desperate
efforts to break his chains. (For the political events of the
period between the first revolt of Mehemet Ali (Sept. 1832) and
the death of Mahmud see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mehemet Ali</a></span>.) The personal attitude
of the sultan, which alone concerns us here, was determined
throughout by his overmastering hatred of the upstart pasha,
of whom he had stooped to ask aid, and who now defied his
will; and the importance of this attitude lies in the fact that,
as the result of the success of his centralizing policy, and notably
of the destruction of the janissaries (<i>q.v.</i>), the supreme authority,
hitherto limited by the practical power of the ministers of the
Porte and by the turbulence of the privileged military caste,
had become concentrated in his own person. It was no longer
the Porte that decided, but the Seraglio, and the sultan&rsquo;s
private secretary had more influence on the policy of the Ottoman
empire than the grand vizier.</p>

<p>This omnipotence of the sultan in deciding the policy of
the government was in striking contrast with his impotence
in enforcing his views on his subjects and in his relations
with foreign powers. Mahmud, in spite of&mdash;or rather because
of&mdash;his well-meant efforts at reform, was hated by his
Mussulman subjects and stigmatized as an &ldquo;infidel&rdquo; and a
traitor to Islam. He was, in fact, a victim to those &ldquo;half-measures&rdquo;
which Machiavelli condemns as fatal to success.
Ibrahim, the conqueror of Syria, scoffed at the sultan&rsquo;s idea
&ldquo;that reform consisted in putting his soldiers into tight
trousers and epaulettes.&rdquo; The criticism is not entirely unjust.
Mahmud&rsquo;s policy was the converse of that recommended
by Machiavelli, viz. in making a revolution to change the
substance while preserving the semblance of the old order.
Metternich&rsquo;s advice to Mahmud to &ldquo;remain a Turk&rdquo; was
sound enough. His failure to do so&mdash;in externals&mdash;left him
isolated in his empire: <i>rayahs</i> and true believers alike distrusted
and hated him. Of this hatred he was fully conscious;
he knew that his subjects, even many of his own ministers,
regarded Mehemet Ali as the champion of Islam against the
&ldquo;infidel sultan;&rdquo; he suspected the pasha, already master
of the sacred cities, of an intention to proclaim himself caliph
in his stead. This, together with the weakness due to military
reforms but recently begun, drove him to rely on foreign aid;
which, in the actual conditions of Europe, meant the aid of
Russia. The long tradition of French friendship for Turkey
had been broken, in 1830, by the conquest of Algiers. Austria
was, for the time, but the faithful ally of the tsar. On the
9th of August 1832 Mahmud made, through Stratford Canning,
a formal proposal for an alliance with Great Britain, which
Palmerston refused to consider for fear of offending France.
Mahm&#363;d bitterly contrasted the fair professions of England
with the offers of effective help from Russia. His old ally
having deserted him, he accepted the aid of his hereditary
foe. The Russian expedition to the Bosporus, the convention
of Kutaiah, and the treaty of Unkiar Skelessi (July 8, 1833)
followed. Mahmud was under no illusion as to the position
in which the latter placed him towards Russia; but his fear
of Mehemet Ali and his desire to be revenged upon him outweighed
all other considerations. He resented the action
of France and England in forcing the settlement of Kutaiah
upon him, and remained shut up in his palace, inaccessible
to all save his favourites and the representative of Russia.
With his single aim in view he busied himself with the creation
of a national militia, with the aid of Moltke and other German
officers. In 1834 the revolt of Syria against Ibrahim seemed
to give him his opportunity. He pleaded the duty of a sultan
to go to the aid of his subjects when oppressed by one of his
servants; but the powers were obdurate, even Russia, much
occupied in affairs nearer home, leaving him in the lurch. He
was astute enough to take advantage of the offence given to
the powers by Mehemet Ali&rsquo;s system of monopolies, and in
1838 signed with Great Britain, and afterwards with others,
a commercial treaty which cut at the root of the pasha&rsquo;s system.
A few months later his passionate impatience overcame his
policy and his fears. The hand of death was upon him, and
he felt that he must strike now or never. In vain the powers,
now united in their views, warned him of the probable consequences
of any aggressive action on his part. He would
rather die, he exclaimed, or become the slave of Russia, than
not destroy his rebellious vassal. On his sole initiative, without
consulting his ministers or the council of the empire, he sent
instructions to Hafiz Pasha, commanding the Ottoman troops
concentrated at Bir on the Euphrates, to advance into Syria.
The fatal outcome of the campaign that followed he did
not live to hear. When the news of Ibrahim&rsquo;s overwhelming
victory at Nessib (June 24, 1839) reached Constantinople,
Mahmud lay dying and unconscious. Early in the morning
of the 1st of July his proud and passionate spirit passed away.</p>

<p>Mahmud II. cannot be reckoned among the great sultans,
neither had he any of the calculating statecraft which characterized
Abd-ul-Hamid II.; but his qualities of mind and heart,
none the less, raised him far above the mass of his predecessors
and successors. He was well versed in state affairs and loyal
to those who advised and served him, personally brave, humane
and kindly when not maddened by passion, active and energetic,
and always a man of his word. Unhappily, however, the
taint of the immemorial corruption of Byzantium had fallen
upon him too, and the avenue to his favour and to political
power lay too often through unspeakable paths. In view of
the vast difficulty of the task before him at his succession it
is less surprising that he failed to carry out his ideas than
that he accomplished so much. When he came to the throne
the empire was breaking up from within; one by one he freed
the provinces from the tyrannical rulers who, like Ali of Jannina,
were carving out independent, or quasi-independent, empires
within the empire. If he failed in his wider schemes of reform,
this was only one more illustration of a truth of which other
&ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; sovereigns besides himself had experienced
the force, namely, that it is impossible to impose any system,
however admirable, from above on a people whose deepest
convictions and prejudices it offends.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAHMUD NEDIM PASHA<a name="ar30" id="ar30"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1818-1883), Turkish statesman,
was the son of Nejib Pasha, ex-governor-general of Bagdad.
After occupying various subordinate posts at the Porte he became
successively under-secretary of state for foreign affairs, governor-general
of Syria and Smyrna, minister of commerce, and governor-general
of Tripoli; minister successively of justice and of
marine (1869); grand vizier from 1871 to 1872 and from 1875 to
1876. He was high in favour with Sultan Abd-ul-Aziz and fell
much under the influence of General Ignatiev, the forceful
Russian ambassador before the war of 1877-78, his subserviency
to Russia earning for him the nickname of &ldquo;Mahmudoff.&rdquo;
His administration was most unsuccessful from every point of
view, and he was largely responsible for the issue of the decree
suspending the interest on the Turkish funds. He was minister
of the interior from 1879 to 1883.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAHMUD<a name="ar31" id="ar31"></a></span><a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> <span class="bold">OF GHAZNI</span> (971-1030), son of Sabuktag&#299;n,
Afghan conqueror, was born on the 2nd of October 971. His
fame rests chiefly on his successful wars, in particular his
numerous invasions of India. His military capacity, inherited
from his father, Nasir-ud-din Sabuktag&#299;n, was strengthened by
youthful experience in the field. Sabuktag&#299;n, a Turki slave of
Alptag&#299;n, governor of Khorasan under Abdalmalik I. b. Nu&#7717; of
the Samanid dynasty of Bokhara, early brought himself to notice
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Samanids</a></span>). He was raised to high office in the state by
Alptag&#299;n&rsquo;s successor, Ab&#363; Ish&#257;k, and in <span class="scs">A.H.</span> 366 (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 977), by
the choice of the nobles of Ghazni, he became their ruler. He
soon began to make conquests in the neighbouring countries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page398" id="page398"></a>398</span>
and in these wars he was accompanied by his young son Mahmud.
Before he had reached the age of fourteen he encountered in two
expeditions under his father the Indian forces of Jaipal, raja of
Lahore, whom Sabuktag&#299;n defeated on the Punjab frontier.</p>

<p>In 994 Mahmud was made governor of Khorasan, with the
title of Saif addaula (ud-daula) (&ldquo;Sword of the State&rdquo;) by the
S&#257;m&#257;n&#299;d N&#363;h II. Two years later, his father Sabuktag&#299;n died
in the neighbourhood of Balkh, having declared his second son,
Ismail, who was then with him, to be his successor. As soon as
Ismail had assumed the sovereignty at Balkh, Mahmud, who was
at Nishapur, addressed him in friendly terms, proposing a division
of the territories held by their father at his death. Ismail
rejected the proposal, and was immediately attacked by Mahmud
and defeated. Retreating to Ghazni, he there yielded, and
was imprisoned, and Mahmud obtained undisputed power as
sovereign of Khorasan and Ghazni (997).</p>

<p>The Ghaznevid dynasty is sometimes reckoned by native
historians to commence with Sabuktag&#299;n&rsquo;s conquest of Bost
and Kosd&#257;r (978). But Sabuktag&#299;n, throughout his reign at
Ghazni, continued to acknowledge the S&#257;m&#257;nid suzerainty, as did
Mahmud also, until the time, soon after succeeding to his father&rsquo;s
dominions, when he received from Q&#257;dir, caliph of Bagdad
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Caliphate</a></span>, C. § 25), a <i>khilat</i> (robe of honour), with a letter
recognizing his sovereignty, and conferring on him the titles
<i>Yami&#299;n-addaula</i> (&ldquo;Right hand of the State&rdquo;), and <i>Am&#299;n-ul-Millat</i>
(&ldquo;Guardian of the Faith&rdquo;). From this time it is the
name of the caliph that is inscribed on Mahmud&rsquo;s coins, together
with his own new titles. Previously the name of the S&#257;m&#257;nid
sovereign, Mans&#363;r II. b. N&#363;h is given along with his own former
title, Saif addaula Mahm&#363;d. The earliest of those of the new
form gives his name Mahm&#363;d bin Sabuktag&#299;n. Thereafter his
father&rsquo;s name does not appear on his coins, but it is inscribed
again on his tomb.</p>

<p>The new honours received from the caliph gave fresh impulse
to Mahmud&rsquo;s zeal on behalf of Islam, and he resolved on an
annual expedition against the idolaters of India. He could not
quite carry out this intention, but a great part of his reign was
occupied with his Indian campaigns. In 1000 he started on
the first of these expeditions, but it does not appear that he
went farther than the hill country near Peshawar. The hostile
attitude of Khalaf ibn Ahmad, governor of Seistan, called
Mahmud to that province for a short time. He was appeased
by Khalaf&rsquo;s speedy submission, together with the gift of a
large sum of money, and further, it is said, by his subdued
opponent addressing him as <i>sult&#257;n</i>, a title new at that time,
and by which Mahmud continued to be called, though he
did not formally adopt it, or stamp it on his coins. Four years
later Khalaf, incurring Mahmud&rsquo;s displeasure again, was imprisoned,
and his property confiscated.</p>

<p>Mahmud&rsquo;s army first crossed the Indus in 1001, opposed by
Jaip&#257;l, raja of Lahore. Jaip&#257;l was defeated, and Mahmud,
after his return from this expedition, is said to have taken the
distinctive appellation of <i>Gh&#257;zi</i> (&ldquo;Valiant for the Faith&rdquo;), but
he is rarely so-called. On the next occasion (1005) Mahmud
advanced, as far as Bhera on the Jhelum, when his adversary
Anang-p&#257;l, son and successor of Jaip&#257;l, fled to Kashmir. The
following year saw Mahmud at Multan. When he was in the
Punjab at this time, he heard of the invasion of Khor&#257;san by
the Ilek Khan Nasr I. ruler of Transoxiana whose daughter
Mahmud had married. After a rapid march back from India,
Mahmud repelled the invaders. The Ilek Khan, having retreated
across the Oxus, returned with reinforcements, and took
up a position a few miles from Balkh, where he was signally
defeated by Mahmud.</p>

<p>Mahmud again entered the Punjab in 1008, this time for the
express purpose of chastising S&#275;wah P&#257;l, who, having become
a Mussulman, and been left by Mahmud in charge of Multan,
had relapsed to Hinduism. The Indian campaign of 1009 was
notable. Near the Indus Mahmud was opposed again by Anang-p&#257;l,
supported by powerful rajas from other parts of India.
After a severe fight, Anang-p&#257;l&rsquo;s elephants were so terror-struck
by the fire-missiles flung amongst them by the invaders that they
turned and fled, the whole army retreating in confusion and
leaving Mahmud master of the field. Mahmud, after this victory,
pushed on through the Punjab to Nagar-k&#333;t (Kangra), and carried
off much spoil from the Hindu temples to enrich his treasury
at Ghazni. In 1011 Mahmud, after a short campaign against
the Afghans under Mahommed ibn S&#363;r in the hill country of
Ghur, marched again into the Punjab. The next time (1014)
he advanced to Than&#275;sar, another noted stronghold of Hinduism,
between the Sutlej and the Jumna. Having now found his way
across all the Punjab rivers, he was induced on two subsequent
occasions to go still farther. But first he designed an invasion
of Kashmir (1015), which was not carried out, as his progress
was checked at L&#333;h-k&#333;t, a strong hill fort in the north-west of
the Punjab. Then before undertaking his longer inroad into
Hindustan he had to march north into Khw&#257;rizm (Khiva)
against his brother-in-law Mam&#363;n, who had refused to acknowledge
Mahmud&rsquo;s supremacy. The result was as usual, and Mahmud,
having committed Khw&#257;rizm to a new ruler, one of Mam&#363;n&rsquo;s
chief officers, returned to his capital. Then in 1018, with a very
large force, he proceeded to India again, extending his inroad
this time to the great Hindu cities of Mathra on the Jumna and
Kanauj on the Ganges. He reduced the one, received the submission
of the other, and carried back great stores of plunder.
Three years later he went into India again, marching over nearly
the same ground, to the support, this time, of the raja of Kanauj,
who, having made friendship with the Mahommedan invader
on his last visit, had been attacked by the raja of Kalinjar. But
Mahmud found he had not yet sufficiently subdued the idolaters
nearer his own border, between Kabul and the Indus, and the
campaign of 1022 was directed against them, and reached no
farther than Peshawar. Another march into India the following
year was made direct to Gwalior.</p>

<p>The next expedition (1025) is the most famous of all. The
point to which it was directed was the temple of Somnath on the
coast of the Gujar&#257;t peninsula. After an arduous journey by
Multan, and through part of Rajputana, he reached Somnath,
and met with a very vigorous but fruitless resistance on the part
of the Hindus of Gujar&#257;t. Moslem feet soon trod the courts of
the great temple. The chief object of worship it contained was
broken up, and the fragments kept to be carried off to Ghazni.
The story is often told of the hollow figure, cleft by Mahmud&rsquo;s
battle-axe, pouring out great store of costly jewels and gold.
But the idol in this Sivite temple was only a tall block or pillar
of hewn stone, of a familiar kind. The popular legend is a very
natural one. Mahmud, it was well known, made Hindu temples
yield up their most precious things. He was a determined idol-breaker.
And the stone block in this temple was enriched with
a crown of jewels, the gifts of wealthy worshippers. These data
readily give the Somnath exploit its more dramatic form. For
the more recent story of the Somnath gates see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Somnath</a></span>.</p>

<p>After the successes at Somnath, Mahmud remained some
months in India before returning to Ghazni. Then in 1026
he crossed the Indus once more into the Punjab. His brilliant
military career closed with an expedition to Persia, in the third
year after this, his last, visit to India. The Indian campaigns
of Mahmud and his father were almost, but not altogether,
unvarying successes. The Moslem historians touch lightly on
reverses. And, although the annals of Rajputana tell how
Sabuktag&#299;n was defeated by one raja of Ajmere and Mahmud by
his successor, the course of events which followed shows how
little these and other reverses affected the invader&rsquo;s progress.
Mahmud&rsquo;s failure at Ajmere, when the brave raja Bisal-deo
obliged him to raise the siege but was himself slain, was when
the Moslem army was on its way to Somnath. Yet Mahmud&rsquo;s
Indian conquests, striking and important in themselves, were,
after all, in great measure barren, except to the Ghazni treasury.
Mahmud retained no possessions in India under his own direct
rule. But after the repeated defeats, by his father and himself,
of two successive rajas of Lahore, the conqueror assumed the
right of nominating the governors of the Punjab as a dependency
of Ghazni, a right which continued to be exercised by seven of
his successors. And for a time, in the reign of Masa&lsquo;ud II.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page399" id="page399"></a>399</span>
(1098-1114), Lahore was the place of residence of the Ghaznevid

<p>Mahmud died at Ghazni in 1030, the year following his expedition
to Persia. He is conspicuous for his military ardour,
his ambition, strong will, perseverance, watchfulness and
energy, combined with great courage and unbounded self-reliance.
But his tastes were not exclusively military. His
love of literature brought men of learning to Ghazni, and his
acquaintance with Moslem theology was recognized by the
learned doctors.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAHOGANY,<a name="ar33" id="ar33"></a></span> a dark-coloured wood largely used for household
furniture, the product of a large tree indigenous to Central
America and the West Indies. It was originally received from
Jamaica; 521,300 ft. were exported from that island in 1753.
It is known botanically as <i>Swietenia Mahogani</i>, and is a member
of the order <i>Meliaceae</i>. It bears compound leaves, resembling
those of the ash, and clusters of small flowers, with five sepals and
petals and ten stamens which are united into a tube. The fruit
is a pear-shaped woody capsule, and contains many winged
seeds. The dark-coloured bark has been considered a febrifuge,
and the seeds were used by the ancient Aztecs with oil for a cosmetic,
but the most valuable product is the timber, first noticed
by the carpenter on board Sir Walter Raleigh&rsquo;s ship in 1595 for
its great beauty, hardness and durability. Dr Gibbons brought
it into notice as well adapted for furniture in the early part of
the 18th century, and its use as a cabinet wood was first practically
established by a cabinet-maker named Wollaston, who was
employed by Gibbons to work up some mahogany brought to
England by his brother. It was introduced into India in 1795,
and is now cultivated in Bengal and as far north as Saharunpur.</p>

<p>The timber of species of <i>Cedrela</i> and <i>Melia</i>, other members of the
order <i>Meliaceae</i>, are used as Mahogany, and the product of the
West African <i>Khaya senegalensis</i> is known as African mahogany.
There is some confusion between the product of these various
trees. Herbert Stone (<i>The Timbers of Commerce</i>, 1904) says:
&ldquo;The various species of mahogany and cedar are so confusing that
it is difficult to make precise statements as to their structure or
origin. I know of no convincing proof that any of the American
kinds met with on the English market are the wood of <i>Swietenia
Mahogani</i>, nor that those shipped from Africa are the wood of
<i>Khaya senegalensis</i>. These two genera are very nearly allied to
<i>Cedrela</i> and <i>Melia</i>, and it is difficult to separate any of the four from
the rest by the characters of the wood. After giving the most
careful attention to every detail, I lean to the view that most if
not all of the mahoganies commonly met with are Cedrelas.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAHOMET<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span> (strictly <span class="sc">Mu&#7717;ammad</span>, commonly also <span class="sc">Mohammed</span>),
founder of the religious system called in Europe after him
Mahommedanism, and by himself Islam or &#7716;anifism. He died,
according to the ordinary synchronism, on the 7th of June 632
(12 Rabia, <span class="scs">A.H.</span> 11), and his birthday was exactly sixty-three
or sixty-five years earlier, the latter number being evidently
an interpretation in lunar years of a number thought to refer
to solar years. The lunar system was introduced into Arabia
by Mahomet himself quite at the close of his career; that which
existed before was certainly solar, as it involved a process of
intercalation&mdash;which, however, seems to have been arbitrarily
manipulated by priests, whence certain synchronisms cannot be
got for the events in the Prophet&rsquo;s career. The number 63 for
the years of his life may rest on tradition, though it is unlikely
that such matters were accurately noted; it can also be accounted
for by a priori combination. A Meccan, it is said, became a full
citizen at the age of 40; this then would be the age at which the
mission might be started. The Medina period (of which count
was kept) lasted ten to eleven years; for the Meccan period
ten years would seem a likely length. Finally it was known that
for some years&mdash;about three&mdash;the mission had been conducted
secretly. The only event in contemporary history to which the
Koran alludes in its earlier parts is the Persian conquest of
Palestine in 616. Clearly Mahomet had begun to prophesy at
that date.</p>

<p>Before the rise of Islam, Mahomet&rsquo;s native place, Mecca,
appears to figure nowhere in historical records, unless there
be a reference to it in the &ldquo;valley of Baca&rdquo; (Psalm
lxxxiv. 6). Its sacred, and therefore archaic, name
<span class="sidenote">His Country.</span>
is <i>Bakkah</i>; hence the identification of the name with
that of the sanctuary Makoraba, known to the Greek geographers,
is not philologically tenable; although so eminent a
linguist as Dozy evolved a theory of the origin of the city from
this name, which appears to be South Arabian for &ldquo;sanctuary,&rdquo;
and has no connexion with Hebrew (as Dozy supposed).
In the 3rd century of Islam the mythology of Mecca was
collected and published in book form, but we learn little more
from it than names of tribes and places; it is clear that there
was no record of the mode in which the community inhabiting
the place had got there, and that little was remembered with
accuracy of the events which preceded the rise of its prophet.
The city had a sanctuary, called the <i>Cube</i> (<i>ka&lsquo;ba</i>), of which
the nucleus was the &ldquo;Black Stone,&rdquo; probably to be identified
with Allah, the god of the community; both still exist, or rather
their legitimate substitutes, as the Ka&lsquo;ba has been repeatedly
reconstructed, and the original Black Stone was stolen by the Carmathians
in the 4th century of Islam; they afterwards returned
one, but it may or may not have been the same as that which
they removed. At some time in the 6th century&mdash;said to have
been the birth-year of the Prophet, but really much earlier&mdash;an
Abyssinian invader raided Mecca with the view of abolishing
this sanctuary; but for some reason had to desist. This expedition,
known as the &ldquo;Raid of the Elephant,&rdquo; one of these animals
being employed in it, seems to be of great importance for explaining
the rise of Islam; for a sanctuary which can repel an
invader acquires tremendous reputation. Some verses in the
Koran which are perhaps not genuine, record the miracle whereby
Allah repelled the &ldquo;People of the Elephant.&rdquo; The sanctuary
was apparently in the possession of the tribe Koreish (Quraish),
the origin of whose name is unknown, said to have come originally
from Cutha in Mesopotamia. They were known (we are
told) as the people of Allah, and, by wearing a badge, were
sacrosanct throughout Arabia. If this be true, it was probably
a privilege earned by the miraculous defence of the Ka&lsquo;ba, and
is sufficient to account for the rise of Meccan commerce of
which we hear much in the biography of the Prophet, and to
which some verses of the earliest part of the Koran allude; for
merchants who were safe from attacks by bandits would have
an enormous advantage. The records seem, however, to be
inconsistent with this assertion; and the growth of the Meccan
commerce is sufficiently accounted for by the fact that after
the Abyssinian invasion pilgrimage to the Ka&lsquo;ba became the
practice of numerous Arab tribes, and for four months in the
year (selected by Meccan priests) raiding was forbidden, in order
to enable the pilgrimage to be safely made. In addition to this
it would seem that all Mecca counted as sanctuary&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> no blood
might under any circumstances be shed there. The community
lived by purveying to pilgrims and the carrying trade; and both
these operations led to the immigration of strangers.</p>

<p>There seems to be no doubt that Mahomet was himself a member
of the tribe Koreish, and indeed too many of his relatives figure
in history to permit of his parentage being questioned.
His cousin &lsquo;Ali, fourth caliph, was the son of Ab&#363;
<span class="sidenote">Mahomet&rsquo;s Family.</span>
&#7788;&#257;lib, whose name attests the historical character of
the kindred name &lsquo;Abd al-Mo&#7789;&#7789;alib, Mahomet&rsquo;s grandfather: for
the fact that this name is in part enigmatical is certainly no
argument against its genuineness. In the 3rd century of Islam
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>400</span>
a document was shown in which a man of San&rsquo;a in Yemen
acknowledged that he had borrowed from &lsquo;Abd al-Mo&#7789;&#7789;alib 1000
silver dirhems of the Hudaida standard, and All&#257;h with the
two &ldquo;angels&rdquo; (probably a euphemism for the goddesses Al-l&#257;t
and al-&lsquo;Uzz&#257;) served as witness; it is difficult to see why such a
document should have been forged. The name H&#257;shim (for
&lsquo;Abd al-Mo&#7789;&#7789;alib&rsquo;s father) may or may not be historical; here, as
in the ascending line throughout, we have subjects without
predicates. The name of &lsquo;Abd al-Mo&#7789;&#7789;alib&rsquo;s son, who was
Mahomet&rsquo;s father, is given as &lsquo;Abdall&#257;h; the correctness of this
has been questioned, because &ldquo;Servant of Allah&rdquo; would seem
to be too appropriate, and the name was often given by the
Prophet to converts as a substitute for some pagan appellation.
This, however, is hypercritical, as the name of the father could
not easily be altered, when relatives abounded, and it would seem
that at one time the Prophet made no theological use of the name
Allah, for which he intended to substitute Ra&#7717;m&#257;n. The name
of his mother is given as &#256;minah, and with this one of his own
titles, Am&#299;n, agrees; although the Arabs do not appear to bring
the two into connexion. Her father&rsquo;s name is given as Wahb,
and she is brought into relation with a Medinese tribe called the
Ban&#363; &lsquo;Ad&#299; b. al-Najj&#257;r, to whom she is said to have brought her
son in his early infancy. The circumstances may have been
suggested by his later connexion with that place; yet in what
seems a historical narrative her grave is mentioned as known
to be at Abwa, midway between the two cities, whence this early
bond between the Prophet and his future home may have really
existed.</p>

<p>His own name is given in the Koran in the forms A&#7717;mad and
the familiar Mu&#7717;ammad; in contemporary poetry we also find
the form Ma&#7717;m&#363;d. Similar variation between derivatives from
the same root is found in proper names which occur in early
poetry; the meaning of all would be &ldquo;the praised,&rdquo; if the root
be given its Arabic signification&mdash;&ldquo;the desired&rdquo; if interpreted
from the Hebrew.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The form Mu&#7717;ammad (ordinarily transliterated Mohammed;
Mahomet, Mehmet, &amp;c., represent the Turkish pronunciation) is
found in a pre-Islamic inscription, and appears to have been fairly
common in Arabia. In Hag. ii. 7 a derivative of the Hebrew
equivalent root occurs in the prophecy &ldquo;and the desired of all
nations shall come,&rdquo; and this passage has suggested the idea that
the name may have been taken by the Prophet as the equivalent
of &ldquo;Messiah,&rdquo; while the Moslems themselves find its equivalent in
the <i>Paraclete</i> of the Fourth Gospel, though this identification requires
more ingenuity. His <i>kunyah</i> (<i>i.e.</i> the Arab title of respect,
in which a man is called after his son) is Abu&lsquo;l-Q&#257;sim; other names
by which he is called are titles of honour, <i>e.g.</i> Mu&#7779;&#7789;af&#257; &ldquo;chosen.&rdquo;
(See further the genealogical table, <i>ad fin.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>In the Koran, Allah says that He found the Prophet an
orphan, poor and astray; it is possible that all these expressions
should be understood figuratively, like the &ldquo;poor,
naked, blind&rdquo; of Christian hymns; the Arabs, however,
<span class="sidenote">Early Life.</span>
take them literally, and Mahomet is said to have been a
posthumous child, whose mother died a few months or years after
his birth, and who was brought up first by his grandfather, and
then by his uncle Ab&#363; &#7788;&#257;lib, one of the poorer members of the
family; in the controversy between the Alid and Abbasid pretenders
of the 2nd century of Islam the Abbasid Man&#7779;&#363;r claims
that his ancestor fed the ancestor of &lsquo;Ali, <i>i.e.</i> Ab&#363; &#7788;&#257;lib, otherwise
he would have had to beg. There was evidently an
apparent inconsistency between Mahomet&rsquo;s being a poor orphan
and the favourite grandchild of the eminent and wealthy &lsquo;Abd
al-Mo&#7789;&#7789;alib; and it was solved in this way. There was a tradition
that in his early years he was sent into the desert to acquire the
habits and the language of the Bedouins; and this seems to have
been attested by the Prophet himself. In a tribal fight he is said
to have acted as armour-bearer to one of his uncles, Zubair.
There seems no doubt that he often accompanied Meccan
caravans to the countries with which the Meccans had trade
relations; such especially were Syria and south Arabia, and
perhaps Egypt and Mesopotamia. It is conceivable that he may
have visited Abyssinia by sea. For though accurate knowledge
is nowhere to be found in the Koran, it exhibits a large amount of
miscellaneous information, such as a trader might well pick up.
His career as a caravan-conductor appears to have terminated
with his marriage to Khad&#299;ja, daughter of Khuwailid, represented
by the tradition as a wealthy widow, fifteen years his senior
and forty years of age at the time of the union. As she became
the mother of a numerous family, a special rule was discovered
by Moslem physiologists extending the child-bearing period of
Korashite women beyond that of others. Since it is claimed
for Mahomet that he first gave Arab women the right to inherit
property, the difficulty noticed is not the only one connected
with this marriage; and Robertson Smith has called attention
to some others, unconnected with his theory of &ldquo;marriage and
kinship in early Arabia.&rdquo; After his marriage Mahomet appears
to have been partner in a shop in Mecca; where he apparently
sold agricultural produce. His style is strongly marked by
phrases and metaphors drawn from trade, though as a statesman
he never displayed any financial ability.</p>

<p>Writing in the monumental script of South Arabia had been
known for centuries in the peninsula; and shortly before the rise
of Islam a cursive script&mdash;the parent of the ordinary
Arabic character&mdash;had been started in the Christian
<span class="sidenote">Education.</span>
state of Hira, with which the beginnings of modern Arabic
literature are connected. A modification of this had been introduced
into Mecca, and was probably used for contracts and
similar documents. The word <i>umm&#299;</i>, literally &ldquo;popular&rdquo; or
&ldquo;plebeian&rdquo; (according to one etymology), applied to Mahomet in
the Koran, is said to mean &ldquo;one who can neither read nor write,&rdquo;
and the most generally accepted view is that he could do neither,
a supposition which enters into the doctrine of the miraculous
nature of the Koran. According to another interpretation the
word means &ldquo;Meccan,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> native of &ldquo;the Mother of the
Villages&rdquo; (<i>Umm al-Qura</i>); and the most probable theory is that
he could do both, but unskilfully. Indeed on one historic
occasion he erased certain words in a document; and where in
the Koran he rebuts the charge of &ldquo;taking notes,&rdquo; he does not
employ the obvious retort that he could not write, but gives a
far less convincing answer. For poetry, which seems to have
been cultivated in Arabia long before his time, he possessed no
ear; but we have little reason for supposing that either writing
or versification had yet entered into Arabian education. The
former would be acquired by those who needed it, the latter was
regarded as a natural gift. There is reason for thinking the
language of the Koran incorrect and ungrammatical in parts,
but as it afterwards became the ultimate standard of classical
Arabic, this point is not easy to prove. On the whole then his
early life seems to have been such as was normal in the case of a
man belonging to one of the more important families in a community
which had not long been started on a career of prosperity.</p>

<p>Of the organization of that community we unfortunately
know very little, though we hear of a council-chamber, and, as
has been seen, of an age-qualification for admission
to it. It is, however, certain that the theory of
<span class="sidenote">Social System.</span>
decision by majority was absolutely unknown to
Mahomet&rsquo;s second successor, whence we learn little from this
tradition (even if it be authentic) of the mode whereby
the tribes who together formed the Meccan population
managed their common concerns, whether commercial or
political. The form of government seems to have been
a rudimentary oligarchy, directed by some masterful individual;
before the Flight we read of various prominent
personages, after the Flight and the battle of Badr (<span class="scs">A.H.</span> 2)
one chieftain, Ab&#363; Sofi&#257;n (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Caliphate</a></span>, <i>ad init.</i>), appears
to take the lead whether in war or in policy. It would
seem, however, that the right of independent action belonged
to the individual tribes, even to the extent of refusing to take
part in a campaign. For the settlement of ordinary disputes
recourse was had (it appears) rather to soothsayers, near or distant,
than to any regularly constituted authority or tribunal.
On the other hand we are furnished with a list of officials who
were concerned with different parts of the festal performances
and the ordinary worship. Of these we may mention the
Custodian of the Ka&lsquo;ba, and the official whose duty was <i>siq&#257;yah</i>
(&ldquo;watering&rdquo;), said to mean furnishing the pilgrims with water,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page401" id="page401"></a>401</span>
but more ingeniously interpreted in recent times as &ldquo;rain-bringing,&rdquo;
a function which even in the 2nd century of Islam the
governor in some places was supposed to exercise.</p>

<p>Of Arabian paganism we possess no trustworthy or complete
account; since we hear of no theological literature belonging to it,
probably no such account could have been given.
There were doubtless a variety of practices, many of
<span class="sidenote">Beginnings of the Mission.</span>
which have been continued to this day in the ceremonies
of the pilgrimage, and offerings of different sorts to various
deities, interpreted variously by the worshippers in accordance
with their spiritual, intellectual and moral levels; <i>e.g.</i> as actual
stones, or as men (or more often women) residing in the stones
or otherwise connected with them, or bearing a similar relation
to trees, or stars, &amp;c. In general every tribe had its patron of
the kind, and where there were aggregations of tribes, connexions
were established between these deities, and affiliation-theories
excogitated; hence the theory attributed in the Koran to the
Meccans that the goddesses al-&lsquo;Uzz&#257;, &amp;c. were the daughters of
Allah, may well represent the outcome of such speculation.
These, however, were known to few, whereas the practices were
familiar to all. Some of these were harmless, others barbarous;
many offensive, but not very reprehensible, superstitions.</p>

<p>Before Mahomet&rsquo;s time Arabian paganism had already been
attacked both from the outside and from the inside. On the
one hand the northern tribes had gradually been
christianized, owing to the influence of the Byzantine
<span class="sidenote">External Influences.</span>
empire; on the other hand south Arabia had fallen
successively under Jewish, Abyssinian and Persian influence;
and the last, though little is known of Persian rule, is unlikely
to have favoured pagan cults. Christianity had also
some important representation in Najran far south of
Mecca, while Jewish settlements were prospering north of
Mecca in the Prophet&rsquo;s future home Yathrib and its neighbourhood.
Power, civilization and learning were thus associated
with monotheism (Judaism), dualism (Mazdaism) and
tritheism (as the Arabs interpreted Christianity); paganism
was the religion of ignorance (<i>j&#257;hiliyyah</i>, interpreted by Goldziher
as &ldquo;barbarism,&rdquo; but the difference is not very considerable).
Mecca itself and the neighbouring and allied &#7788;&#257;if are said to have
produced some monotheists or Christians, who identified the
<i>Allah</i> of Mecca with the <i>All&#257;h&#257;</i> or God of the Syrian Christians,
called by the Abyssinian Christians &ldquo;Lord of the Regions,&rdquo;
and by the Jews &ldquo;the Merciful&rdquo; (<i>Ra&#7717;m&#257;n&#257;</i>); one such is said
to have been a cousin of Khadija, Mahomet&rsquo;s wife; his name is
given as Waraqah, son of Naufal, and he is credited with copying
or translating a Gospel. We even hear of flagellant monks and
persons vowed to total abstinence among the precursors of
Islam.</p>

<p>With these persons Mahomet had little in common, since they
do not appear to have claimed to enforce their views upon others,
or to have interfered with politics. He appears mainly to have
been struck by the personality of the founders of the systems
dominant in the civilized world, and to have aspired from the first
to occupy the place of legislator or mouthpiece of the Deity; and
that he was this was and is the main proposition of the Mahommedan
creed. The &ldquo;Prophet&rdquo; or &ldquo;Apostle&rdquo; (at different
times he employed both the Jewish and the Christian phrase)
was the divinely appointed dictator of his community; if he were
not obeyed, divine vengeance would overtake the disobedient.
At this proposition Mahomet arrived by induction from the records
of the Biblical prophets, as well as others who seem to have
figured in Arabian mythology, <i>e.g.</i> the destruction of the tribe
Tham&#363;d (mentioned by Pliny, and therefore historical) for their
disobedience to their prophet &#7778;&#257;li&#7717;, and of &lsquo;Ad (probably mythical)
for their similar treatment of H&#363;d. The character of the
message did not affect the necessity for obedience; at times it
was condemnation of some moral offence, at others a trivial
order. Divine vengeance overtook those who disobeyed either.</p>

<p>This is the theory of the prophetic office which pervades the
Koran, wherein the doctrine is formulated that every nation
had its divine guide and that Mecca before Mahomet&rsquo;s time had
none. This place, then, Mahomet felt a divine call to fill.
<span class="sidenote">The Prophet&rsquo;s Call.</span>
But we are never likely to ascertain what first put the idea into
his mind. The fables which his biographers tell on this
subject are not worth repeating; his own system, in
which he is brought into direct communication with
the Deity, though at a later period the angel Gabriel
appears to have acted as intermediary, naturally leaves no room
for such speculations; and since his dispensation was thought
to be absolutely new, and to make a <i>tabula rasa</i> of the pagan
past, his first followers, having broken with that past, left no
intelligible account of the state of affairs which preceded their
master&rsquo;s call. Some generations therefore elapsed before that
past was studied with any sort of sympathy, and details could
not then be recovered, any more than they can now be supplied
by conjecture.</p>

<p>So far as Mahomet may be said from the first to have formulated
a definite notion of his work, we should probably be right
in thinking it to be the restoration of the religion of Abraham, or
(as the Koran calls him) Ibrahim. Though we have no reason
for supposing the name of Abraham or Ishmael to have been
known in Mecca generally before Mahomet&rsquo;s time, the Biblical
ethnology was not apparently questioned by those who were
told of it, and there are stories, not necessarily apocryphal, of
precursors of Mahomet going abroad in search of the &ldquo;religion
of Abraham.&rdquo; One feature of that system, associated in the
Bible with the name of Ishmael as well, was circumcision, which
was actually observed by the Meccan tribes, though it would
appear with technical differences from the Jewish method; the
association of monotheism with it would seem reasonable enough,
in view of Jewish traditions, such as Mahomet may have heard
on his travels; why the doctrine of the future life should be
coupled with it is less obvious. That the Meccan temple and its
rites had been founded by these two patriarchs appears to have
been deduced by Mahomet himself, but perhaps at a later stage
of his career. That these rites, so far as they were idolatrous,
were in flagrant defiance of the religion of Abraham must have
struck any one who accepted the accounts of it which were
current among Jews and Christians. The precursors, however,
appear to have felt no call to reform their fellow-citizens; whereas
it is evident that Mahomet regarded himself as charged with a
message, which he was bound to deliver, and which his God
would in some way render effective.</p>

<p>As it was obvious that the claim to be God&rsquo;s mouthpiece
was to claim autocracy, Mahomet employed the utmost caution
in his mode of asserting this claim; on the question of his sincerity
there have been different opinions held, and it is not
necessary to take any view on this matter. For three years
his followers were a secret society; and this period appears to
have been preceded by one of private preparation, the first
revelation being received when the Prophet was in religious
retirement&mdash;a ceremony called <i>ta&#7717;annuth</i>, of which the meaning
is uncertain, but which can have no connexion with the
Hebrew <i>te&#7717;inn&#333;th</i> (&ldquo;supplications&rdquo;)&mdash;on Mount &#7716;ir&#257;, near
Mecca.</p>

<p>If the traditional dates assigned to the <i>suras</i> (chapters) of
the Koran (<i>q.v.</i>) are correct, the earliest revelations took the form
of pages or rolls which the Prophet was to read by the &ldquo;grace of
God,&rdquo; as Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormon community,
<span class="sidenote">The Koran.</span>
said of the power given him to read the &ldquo;Egyptian&rdquo;
characters on the gold plates which he had found.
The command to read is accompanied by the statement that &ldquo;his
most generous Lord had taught man by the pen (<i>calamus</i>) that
which he did not know.&rdquo; Waraqah, to whom the event is said
to have been communicated by Khadija, called these communications
&ldquo;the Greater Law (<i>nomos</i>).&rdquo; The Prophet was directed
to communicate his mission at the first only to his nearest
relatives. The utterances were from the first in a sort of rhyme,
such as is said to have been employed for solemn matter in
general, <i>e.g.</i> oracles or prayers. At an early period the production
of a written communication was abandoned for oral communications,
delivered by the Prophet in trance; their delivery
was preceded by copious perspiration, for which the Prophet
prepared (in accordance with instructions found in the Koran)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page402" id="page402"></a>402</span>
by wrapping himself in a blanket. Trusty followers were instructed
to take these utterances down, but the phenomena which
accompanied their delivery at least in one case suggested imposture
to the scribe, who apostatized in consequence. It is
extraordinary that there is no reason to suppose that any official
record was ever kept of these revelations; the Prophet treated
them somewhat as the Sibyl did her leaves. This carelessness
is equally astounding whether the Prophet was sincere or
insincere.</p>

<p>If the matter afterwards collected in the Koran be genuine,
the early revelations must have been miscellaneous in content,
magical, historical and homiletic. To some strange oaths are
prefixed. Apparently the purpose to be compassed was to
convince the audience of their miraculous origin. The formulation
of doctrines belongs to a later period and that of jurisprudence
to the latest of all. In that last period also, when Mahomet
was despot of Medina, the Koran served as an official chronicle,
well compared by Sprenger to the leading articles on current
events in a ministerial organ. Where the continuous paragraph
is substituted for the ejaculation, the divine author
apologizes for the style.</p>

<p>Certain doctrines and practices (<i>e.g.</i> washing of the person
and the garments) must have been enjoined from the first, but
our authorities scarcely give us any clear notion what they were.
The doctrines to which the Prophet himself throughout assigned
most value seem to have been the unity of God and the future
life, or resurrection of the body. The former necessitated the
abandonment of the idolatrous worship which formed part of
the daily life of Mecca, and in which Mahomet and Khadija had
been accustomed to take their part. Yet it seems to have been
due to the initiative of the proselytes themselves rather than to
the Prophet&rsquo;s orders that the Meccan worship was actually
flouted by them; for the anecdote which represents the Prophet
and his young cousin attempting to pull down the images in or
about the Ka&rsquo;ba appears to be apocryphal. The first Moslem
ceremony would appear to have been the religious meeting for
the purpose of hearing the delivery of revelations, of which
after the Prophet&rsquo;s death the sermon (<i>khu&#7789;bah</i>) took the place.
After various provisional meeting-places, the house of one al-Arqam
on Mt. Safa was adopted for this purpose; and here
proselytes were initiated.</p>

<p>The names which the new community received from its
founder are both philological puzzles; for the natural sense of
Moslem (<i>Muslim</i>) appear to be &ldquo;traitors,&rdquo; and to
this a contemporary war-song of Mahomet&rsquo;s enemies
<span class="sidenote">Growth of the Early Community.</span>
alludes; while <i>&#7716;an&#299;f</i> (especially applied in the Koran
to Abraham) seems to be the Hebrew word for &ldquo;hypocrite.&rdquo;
The former is explained in the Koran to mean &ldquo;one who hands
over his face or person to God,&rdquo; and is said to have been invented
by Abraham; of the latter no explanation is given, but it seems
to signify from the context &ldquo;devotee.&rdquo; Since the divine name
<i>Ra&#7717;m&#257;n</i> was at one time favoured by Mahomet, and this was
connected with one Maslama of the tribe &#7716;an&#299;fa, who figures in
politics at the end of Mahomet&rsquo;s career but must have been a
religious leader far earlier, it has been suggested that the names
originally belonged to Maslama&rsquo;s community. The honour
of having been Mahomet&rsquo;s first convert is claimed for three
persons: his wife Khad&#299;ja, his cousin Ali, who must have been
a lad at the commencement of the mission, and Ab&#363; Bekr, son
of Ab&#363; Qu&#7717;&#257;fah, afterwards Mahomet&rsquo;s first successor. This
last person became Mahomet&rsquo;s <i>alter ego</i>, and is usually known as
the <i>&#7778;iddiq</i> (Heb. word signifying &ldquo;the saint,&rdquo; but to the Arabs
meaning &ldquo;faithful friend)&rdquo;. His loyalty from first to last was
absolutely unswerving; he was selected to accompany Mahomet
on the most critical occasion of his life, the Flight from Mecca;
Mahomet is said to have declared that had he ever made a
confidant of any one, that person would have been Ab&#363; Bekr;
implying that there were things which were not confided even to
him. The success of the Prophet&rsquo;s enterprise seems to have been
very largely due to the part played by this adherent, who possessed
a variety of attainments which he put at Mahomet&rsquo;s service;
who when an intermediary was required was always ready to
represent him, and who placed the commendation of the Prophet
above every other consideration, private or public. The two
appear to have regularly laid siege to those persons in Mecca
whose adherence was desirable; and the ability which many
of the earlier converts afterwards displayed, whether as statesmen
or generals, is a remarkable testimony to their power of
gauging men. It seems clear that the growth of wealth in Mecca
had led to the accentuation of the difference between persons of
different station, and that many were discontented with the oligarchy
which governed the city. Converts could, therefore, be
won without serious difficulty among the aliens and in general
those who suffered under various disqualifications. Some
members of the Jewish community seem also to have joined;
and some relics of the Abyssinian expedition (<i>i.e.</i> descendants of
the invaders). Among the most important converts of the
Meccan period were Mahomet&rsquo;s uncle &#7716;amza, afterwards for
his valour called &ldquo;the Lion of God&rdquo;; &lsquo;Abd al-Ra&#7717;man (Abdar-ra&#7717;man)
son of &lsquo;Auf; Othman, son of &lsquo;Aff&#257;n, who married two
of the Prophet&rsquo;s daughters successively, and was Mahomet&rsquo;s
third successor; and, more important than any save Ab&#363; Bekr,
Omar, son of al-Khatt&#257;b, a man of extraordinary force of character,
to whom siege seems to have been laid with extraordinary
skill. At some time he received the honourable title <i>F&#257;r&#363;q</i>
(&ldquo;Deliverer&rdquo;); he is represented as regularly favouring force,
where Ab&#363; Bekr favoured gentle methods; unlike Ab&#363; Bekr,
his loyalty was not always above suspicion. His adherence is
ascribed to the period of publicity.</p>

<p>The secrecy which marked its early years was of the greatest
value for the eventual success of the mission; for when Mahomet
came forward publicly he was already the head of a band of
united followers. His own family appear to have been either
firm adherents, or violent enemies, or lukewarm and temporizing&mdash;this
is the best which can be said for &lsquo;Abb&#257;s, eponymus of the
Abbasid dynasty; or finally espousers of his cause, on family
grounds, but not as believers.</p>

<p>Rejecting accounts of Mahomet&rsquo;s first appearance as a public
preacher, which are evidently comments on a text of the Koran,
we have reason for supposing that his hand was forced
by ardent followers, who many times in his career
<span class="sidenote">First Period of Publicity.</span>
compelled him to advance. The astute rulers of
the community perceived that the claim made by Mahomet
was to be dictator or autocrat; and while this was naturally
ridiculed by them, some appear to have been devoted adherents
of the gods or goddesses whom he attacked. The absence of
dated documents for the period between this open proclamation
(which in any case commenced before 616) and the Flight to
Medina in 622 renders the course of events somewhat conjectural,
though certain details appear to be well established. Apparently
there was a war of words, followed by a resort to diplomacy and
then to force; and then a period in which Mahomet&rsquo;s attention
was directed to foreign conversions, resulting in his being offered
and accepting the dictatorship of Yathrib.</p>

<p>Of the war of words we have an imperfect record in the Meccan
suras of the Koran, which occasionally state the objections urged
by the opponents. In the course of the debate the theological
position of both parties seems to have shifted, and the knowledge
of both was probably increased in various ways. The miracle
of the Koran, which at first consisted in its mode of production,
was transformed into a marvel connected with its contents; first
by Mahomet&rsquo;s claiming to tell historical narratives which had
previously been unknown to him; afterwards by the assertion
that the united efforts of mankind and Jinn would be unable to
match the smallest passage of the Koran in sublimity. Probably
the first of these claims could not be long maintained, though
A. J. Davis, &ldquo;the Seer of Poughkeepsie,&rdquo; in our own time brought
a similar one in regard to his <i>Principles of Nature</i>. Indeed both
parties evidently resorted to external aid. To those who undertook
to name the man who dictated stories of the ancients to
Mahomet day and night, he replied that the individual whom
they had in mind was a foreigner, whereas the Koran was in pure
Arabic. This was obviously a quibble, for it was scarcely
asserted that he delivered the matter dictated to him without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page403" id="page403"></a>403</span>
alteration. The purity of the Arabic also appears to have been
very questionable; for several expressions appear to be Ethiopic
rather than Arabic, and the person whom the Meccans had in
mind is likely to have been an Abyssinian Christian, since the
Christian technicalities of the Koran are mainly derived from
the Ethiopic Gospels and Acts. On one occasion when some
questions suggested by learned foreigners had been propounded
to the Prophet he required a fortnight&rsquo;s delay before the revelation
which solved them came; the matter contained in his reply
was certainly such as required research. His sources of information
seem at all times to have been legendary rather than canonical;
and the community which seemed to his opponents to agree
best with his views was that of the Sabians or Mandaeans (<i>qq.v.</i>).</p>

<p>It has been suggested that Mahomet first threatened the
Meccans with temporal punishment, and only when this threat
failed to take effect resorted to the terrors of the Day of Judgment
and the tortures of Hell; it seems however a mistake to distinguish
between the two. These threats provided the Prophet with his
most powerful sermons. The boasts of incomparable eloquence
which the Koran contains are evidence that his oratorical power
was effective with his audiences, since the more successful among
the Arabic poets talk of their compositions somewhat in the same
way. These discourses certainly led to occasional conversions,
perhaps more frequently among women than men.</p>

<p>The diplomatic war seems to have been due to the Prophet&rsquo;s
increasing success, which led to serious persecution of Mahomet&rsquo;s
less influential followers, though, as has been seen, no
blood could be shed in Mecca. Ab&#363; &#7788;&#257;lib, moreover,
<span class="sidenote">The Exiles in Axum.</span>
prevented him from being exiled, though he probably
had to endure many personal insults. Something however had
to be done for the persecuted Moslems, and (perhaps at the suggestion
of his Abyssinian helper) Mahomet endeavoured to find a
refuge for them in the realm of Axum. Abyssinia was doubtless
connected in every Meccan mind with the &ldquo;Expedition of the
Elephant&rdquo;; and such an alliance secured by Mahomet was a
menace to the existence of the Meccan community. A deputation
was therefore sent by the Meccan leaders to demand extradition
of the exiles; and as chief of this expedition the future conqueror
of Egypt, &lsquo;Amr b. al-&lsquo;&#256;&#7779; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">&lsquo;Amr ibn el-Ass</a></span>), first figures in
history. To frustrate his efforts Mahomet sent his cousin Ja&rsquo;far
armed with an exposition of the Prophet&rsquo;s beliefs and doctrines
afterwards embodied in the Koran as the Sura of Mary (No. XIX.;
though with the addition of some anti-Christian matter). The
original document contained an account of the Nativity of Christ
with various miracles not known to either the canonical or even
the apocryphal gospels which have been preserved, but which
would be found edifying rather than unorthodox by a church one
of whose most popular books is <i>The Miracles of the Virgin Mary</i>.
To this there were added certain notices of Old Testament
prophets. The Abyssinian king and his ecclesiastical advisers
took the side of Mahomet and his followers, whom they appear
to have regarded as persecuted Christians; and an attempt made
probably by the astute &lsquo;Amr to embroil them with the Abyssinians
on the difficult question of the Natures of Christ failed
completely. There seems reason for thinking that the Abyssinian
king contemplated bringing back the exiles by force, but was
diverted from this purpose by frontier wars; meanwhile they
were safely harboured, though they seem to have suffered from
extreme poverty. The want of an Abyssinian chronicle for this
period is a serious disadvantage for the study of Islamic origins.
The sequel shows that regular correspondence went on between
the exiles and those who remained in Mecca, whence the former
were retained within the fold of Islam, with occasional though
rare apostasies to Christianity.</p>

<p>Mahomet&rsquo;s diplomatic victory roused the Meccan leaders to
fury, and they decided on the most vigorous measures to which
they could rise; Ab&#363; &#7788;&#257;lib, Mahomet&rsquo;s protector, and the clan
which acknowledged him as <i>sheikh</i>, including the Prophet and his
family, were blockaded in the quarter which they occupied; as
in other sanctuaries, though blood might not be shed, a culprit
might be starved to death. That this did not occur, though the
siege appears to have lasted some months at least, was due to the
weak good nature of the Meccans, but doubtless also to the fact
that there were enlisted on Mahomet&rsquo;s side many men of great
physical strength and courage (as their subsequent careers
proved), who could with impunity defy the Meccan embargo.
After a time however the besieged found the situation intolerable,
and any assistance which they might have expected from the
king of Axum failed to come. The course adopted by Mahomet
was retractation of those of his utterances which had most
offended the Meccans, involving something like a return to
paganism. A revelation came acknowledging the effectiveness
of the Meccan goddesses as well as Allah, and the Meccans raised
the siege. News of the reconciliation reached the Abyssinian
exiles and they proceeded to return.</p>

<p>By the time they reached the Arabian coast the dispute
had recommenced. The revelation was discovered to be a
fabrication of the Devil, who, it appears, regularly interpolates
in prophetic revelations; such at least is the apology preserved
in the Koran, whence the fabricated verses have been expunged.
Since our knowledge of this episode (regarded as the most disgraceful
in the Prophet&rsquo;s career) is fragmentary, we can only
guess that the Prophet&rsquo;s hand had once more been forced by the
more earnest of his followers, for whom any compromise with
paganism was impossible. The exiles went back to Abyssinia;
and about this time both Ab&#363; &#7788;&#257;lib and Khad&#299;ja died, leaving
the Prophet unprotected.</p>

<p>He fled to the neighbouring oasis of &#7788;&#257;if, where wealthy
Meccans had possessions, and where the goddess al-&lsquo;Uzza was
worshipped with special zeal&mdash;where she is said still to exist in
the form of a block of stone. He had but little success there in
proselytizing, and indeed had to cease preaching; but he opened
negotiations with various Meccan magnates for a promise of
protection in case of his return. This was at last obtained with
difficulty from one Mo&#7789;&lsquo;im b. &lsquo;Adi. It would appear that his
efforts were now confined to preaching to the strangers who
assembled at or near Mecca for the ceremonies connected with
the feasts. He received in consequence some invitations to
come and expound his views away from Mecca, but had to wait
some time before one came of a sort which he could wisely
accept.</p>

<p>The situation which led to Mahomet&rsquo;s Flight (<i>hijra</i>, anglicized
incorrectly <i>hejira</i>, <i>q.v.</i>) was singularly favourable to Mahomet&rsquo;s
enterprise, and utilized by him with extraordinary
caution and skill. At the palm plantation called
<span class="sidenote">The Flight to Yathrib.</span>
Yathrib, afterwards known as <i>al-Medina</i>, Medina,
&ldquo;the City&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> of the Prophet), there were various tribes, the
two most important, called Aus and Khazraj, being pagan, and
engaged in an internecine feud, while under their protection there
were certain Jewish tribes, whose names have come down to us
as Qainuq&#257;, Na&#7693;&#299;r and Quraiza&mdash;implying that the Israelites,
as might be expected, imitated the totem nomenclature of their
neighbours. The memory of these Israelites is exclusively
preserved by the Moslem records; the main stream of Jewish
history flowed elsewhere. In the series of combats between the
Aus and Khazraj the former had generally been worsted; the
Jews, as usual, had avoided taking any active part in the fray.
Finally, owing to an act of gross perfidy, they were compelled
to fight in aid of the Aus; and in the so-called battle of Bu&lsquo;&#257;th
the Aus aided by the Jews had won a victory, doubtless attributed
to the God of the Jews. As has been seen, the divine name
employed by Mahomet (<i>Ra&#7717;m&#257;n</i>) was one familiar to the Jews;
and the Yathribites who visited Mecca at feast-time were
naturally attracted by a professed representative of al-Ra&#7717;m&#257;n.
The first Yathribite converts appear to have been Khazrajites,
and one As&lsquo;ad, son of Zurarah, is the most prominent figure.
Their idea may have been in the first place to secure the aid of the
Israelitish Deity in their next battle with the Aus, and indeed the
primary object of their visit to Mecca is said to have been to request
assistance for their war. For this the plan was substituted
of inviting the Prophet to come to Mecca as dictator, to heal the
feud and restore order, a procedure to which Greek antiquity
offers parallels. The new converts were told to carry on secret
propaganda in Yathrib with this end in view. At the next feast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page404" id="page404"></a>404</span>
some of the rival faction embraced Islam. A trusty follower of
Mahomet, Mus&rsquo;ab b.&rsquo;Umair, who resembled Mahomet in personal
appearance, was sent to Yathrib to assist in the work. The
correspondence between this person and the Prophet would, if
we possessed it, be of the greatest value for the study of Islamic
antiquity. We first hear at this time of <i>the conditions of Islam</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
a series of undertakings into which the convert entered: namely,
to abstain from adultery, theft, infanticide and lying, and to obey
Mahomet <i>in licitis et honestis</i>. The wholesale conversion of
Yathrib was determined by that of two chieftains, Usaid b.
&#7716;uraith and Sa&lsquo;d b. Mu&rsquo;adh, both Ausites. The example of
these was quickly followed, and iconoclasm became rife in the
place. At the next Meccan feast a deputation of seventy Yathribites
brought Mahomet a formal invitation, which he accepted,
after imposing certain conditions. The interviews between
Mahomet and the Yathribites are known as the <i>&lsquo;Aqabah</i> (probably
with reference to a text of the Koran). The attitude of the
Jews towards the project appears to have been favourable.</p>

<p>Among the conditions imposed by Mahomet on his new adherents
appears to have been the protection and harbouring of
the older proselytes, whom Mahomet most wisely determined to
send before him to Yathrib, where, in the event of the
<span class="sidenote">The Refugees.</span>
Yathribite loyalty wavering, they could be counted
on with certainty. The welcome given these refugees
(<i>muh&#257;jir&#363;n</i>), as they were from this time known in contra-distinction
to the helpers (<i>an&#7779;&#257;r</i>) or allies from Yathrib, is said
to have been of the warmest; a Helper with two wives would
hand one over to a wifeless Refugee. A yet more important
condition which preceded the Flight was readiness to fight men
of all colours in defence of the faith.</p>

<p>Although the transactions with the people of Yathrib had been
carried on with profound secrecy, the nature of Mahomet&rsquo;s
contract with his new adherents was somewhat divulged to the
Meccan magnates, and the danger of allowing an implacable
enemy to establish himself on the high-road of their north-bound
caravans flashed upon them. The rule which forbade bloodshed
in the sacred city had at last to be suspended; but elaborate precautions
were to be taken whereby every tribe (except Mahomet&rsquo;s
own clan) should have their share in the guilt, which would thus
be spread over the whole community fairly. When the committee
appointed to perpetrate the crime reached Mahomet&rsquo;s
house, they found that it was too late; Mahomet had already
departed, leaving Ali in his bed.</p>

<p>The actual Flight from Mecca to Yathrib has naturally been
a favourite subject for romance, and indeed appears to have been
executed with the greatest cunning. Accompanied by Ab&#363; Bekr
only, Mahomet took refuge in a cave of Mt Thaur, in the opposite
direction to that which he intended to take finally, and there
remained for three days; provision had been made of every
requisite, food, powerful camels, a trusty and competent guide.
The date at which he reached Kuba, on the outskirts of Yathrib,
where there was already some sort of Moslem oratory, is given as
8 Rabia I., of the year <span class="scs">A.H.</span> 1; the fact that he arrived there on
the Jewish Day of Atonement gives us the date September
20, 622. The Meccans, who had employed professional trackers
to hunt down the fugitives, proceeded to confiscate the houses
and goods of Mahomet and of his followers who had fled.</p>

<p>The safe arrival of Mahomet at his destination marks the
turning-point in his career, which now became one of almost
unbroken success; his intellectual superiority over
both friends and enemies enabling him to profit by
<span class="sidenote">Mahomet as Despot of Yathrib.</span>
defeat little less than by victory. His policy appears
to have been to bind his followers to himself and them to each
other by every possible tie; he instituted brotherhoods between
the Refugees and Helpers, which were to count as relationships
for legal purposes, and having himself no sons, he contracted
numerous marriages partly with the same end in view; <i>e.g.</i> with
the infant daughter of Ab&#363; Bekr, Ayesha (&lsquo;A&rsquo;ishah), whose
ability he appears to have discerned; and the unamiable &#7716;af&#7779;a,
daughter of Omar. Of his own daughters three were given to
faithful allies, the one by whom his line is supposed to have
been continued to our time, F&#257;&#7789;ima, was reserved for his cousin
Ali. Owing to his efforts the alliance between the Refugees
and Helpers resisted numerous attempts on the part of enemies
to break it up, and only towards the end of the Prophet&rsquo;s life,
when he appeared to favour Meccans unduly, do we hear of
any bitterness between the two communities.</p>

<p>The population of Yathrib, or, as it may now be called, Medina,
soon divided into three groups: Mahomet&rsquo;s united followers;
the Jews; and a party known as the &ldquo;Hypocrites,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i> professing Moslems, who were lukewarm, or disaffected,
<span class="sidenote">The Medina Community.</span>
among whom the most prominent is
&lsquo;Abdallah b. Ubayy, a Khazrajite chieftain, who is said to have
himself aspired to be despot of Yathrib, and who till nearly the
end of Mahomet&rsquo;s career figures somewhat as a leader of the
opposition; of his importance there is no question, but the reason
for it and the mode whereby he made it felt are often obscure.
It would seem that the pagans remaining in Yathrib speedily
adopted Islam after the Prophet&rsquo;s arrival, whence we hear little
of serious opposition on their part. Coming in the capacity of
prophet of the Israelitish God, Mahomet at first seems to have
courted alliance with the Jews, and to have been ready to adopt
their system with very slight modifications&mdash;similar to those
which, according to his opinion, Jesus had come to introduce.
The Jews met these advances by submitting him to examination
in the intricacies of the <i>Torah</i>, and, finding him very poorly
equipped, proceeded to denounce him as an imposter; one of his
examiners is said to have even translated the <i>Torah</i> into Arabic
with a view of convicting him of ignorance and imposture. They
are&rsquo; further charged with exercising their magical arts on the
Prophet and his followers, and to have succeeded thereby in
producing barrenness among the Moslem women. Their conduct
must not of course be judged by the statement of their enemies;
it is however clear that Mahomet soon found that there was no
possibility of compromising with them on religious questions,
or of obtaining their loyal support; meanwhile he discovered
that they were incapable of united and persistent action, and
useless as warriors except against each other. He therefore
resolved on their extermination. His ruthlessness in their case
compared with his patience and forbearance in the case of the
&ldquo;Hypocrites&rdquo; was consistent with his principle (always faithfully
observed) that no inquiry was permissible into the motives
of conversion, and with his division of mankind into the two
antagonistic factions Believers and Unbelievers. The latter
principle, as will be seen, was somewhat modified before the
end of his life.</p>

<p>Mahomet&rsquo;s failure to effect a compromise with the Jews
caused a reaction in his mind towards paganism, and after about
a year&rsquo;s residence at Medina the direction of prayer,
which had till then been towards Jerusalem, was
<span class="sidenote">Development of Islam.</span>
turned southward to the pagan temple at Mecca.
With this change we may perhaps couple the adoption of the
name <i>Allah</i> for the <span class="correction" title="amended from Diety">Deity</span>; in the Moslem formula &ldquo;in the Name
of Allah the Ra&#7717;m&#257;n the Merciful,&rdquo; the translation attached to
the word <i>Ra&#7717;m&#257;n</i>, and the prefixing to it of the name <i>Allah</i>
furnish clear evidence of theological transition, though the stages
are not recorded; we know, however, that the Meccans approved
of the name <i>Allah</i>, but objected to the name <i>Ra&#7717;m&#257;n</i>. Prayer
(<i>&#7779;al&#257;t</i>), said to have been prescribed on the occasion of the
Prophet&rsquo;s ascent into heaven after a miraculous journey from
Mecca to Jerusalem, began to assume a stereotyped form in the
place of assembly built by Mahomet immediately after his arrival;
the attitudes of prayer in use among many communities (<i>e.g.</i> the
Jewish standing, the prostration of some Christian sects) were
combined. In general it was Mahomet&rsquo;s principle, while taking
over a practice from some other sect, to modify it so as to render
the Moslem method absolutely distinct; thus when a summons
to prayer became requisite, a new mode (by the voice of a crier
called <i>muaddhin</i> or <i>muezzin</i>) was preferred to the Christian
hammer; a new sacred day was adopted, in lieu of the Jewish
Saturday and the Christian Sunday, in the weekday on which he
had safely reached Kuba, Friday; but the sanctity was reduced to
the actual time occupied by public worship. On the subject of
food he was satisfied with the regulations of the Council of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page405" id="page405"></a>405</span>
Jerusalem, recorded in Acts xv.; which were observed by few if
any Christian sects. The prohibition of wine, which was enacted
in <span class="scs">A.H.</span> 3, is said to have been occasioned by the riotous conduct
of one of his followers when under the influence of liquor;
Palgrave saw in it (perhaps with justice) a deliberate attempt to
prevent harmony between Moslems and Christians, in whose
most sacred rite wine is used. The Fast of Rama&#7693;&#257;n, in which
food both liquid and solid is forbidden from sunrise to sunset, is
said to be a pagan or semi-pagan institution; its importance for
military training and discipline is not likely to have been overlooked
by the Prophet. When the direction of prayer was
altered, it is probable that Mahomet already intended to introduce
into his system the whole of the pagan pilgrimage with its
antique ceremonial (with, of course, a new interpretation);
before this he is supposed to have aimed at the abolition of
the Ka&lsquo;ba and all that appertained to it.</p>

<p>The difference between religious and civil law has never been
recognized by Islamic jurists, whose manuals deal equally with
the law of contract and the amount of the body to be washed
before prayer; the Prophet&rsquo;s ordinances on both subjects were
suggested by the occasion in each case, and it would seem that the
opinions of trusted advisers were regularly heard before a revelation
was issued. Even when this had been done the ordinance
might be cancelled by an abrogating revelation; it being &ldquo;easy
for Allah&rdquo; to substitute for a text already revealed another that
was better or at least as good.</p>

<p>As Islam began to spread outside the limits of Medina both
conversion to Islam and persistence therein were reduced to
simple tests; the pronunciation of the double formula of belief
in Allah and Mahomet was sufficient to indicate conversion,
whilst payment of an income-tax, called by the Jewish names for
alms (<i>zak&#257;t</i> and <i>&#7779;adaqah</i>), was evidence of loyalty. This income-tax,
of which the definite assessment perhaps belongs to a later
period, was for the support of necessitous converts&mdash;an element
in the community whose presence accounts for the mode in which
the development of the Islamic state proceeded.</p>

<p>The industries in which the Meccan Refugees had been engaged
were not of a sort which they could exercise at Medina, where the
palm took the place of the camel as the basis of
society. Moreover the Prophet seems to have given
<span class="sidenote">First Campaigns of Mahomet.</span>
some disastrous advice on the subject of palmiculture,
and thereby to have accentuated the poverty of the place.
He had, therefore, to find some fresh source of revenue in order
to deal with this difficulty, and one of the Helpers is said to
have suggested the plan which he adopted, viz. of attacking
the Meccan caravans. With this view he organized a series of
expeditions, taking the lead himself sometimes, while at others
he gave it to one of his veteran followers; and at first only
Refugees took part in them. The leaders of the caravans, however,
were expert in evading attacks of this sort, which were
doubtless regularly attempted by the desert tribes; and in the
first year of his despotism Mahomet did not score a single success
of the kind intended. The attempts were not wholly fruitless;
for while on the one hand he accustomed his followers to campaigning,
on the other he made a series of agreements with the chieftains
of the tribes through whose territory the caravans ordinarily
passed. Finding continued failure intolerable, he resolved to
take advantage of his power to bind and to loose by sending an
expedition of seven men under his cousin &lsquo;Abdallah b. Ja&#7717;sh to
attack a caravan at the beginning of the sacred month Rajab,
when, as raiding during such a season was unknown, success was
practically certain. The commander on this, the Nakhlah raid,
was given sealed orders, to be opened after two days&rsquo; march;
the men were then to be given the option of retiring, if they disapproved.
Of this no one seems definitely to have availed himself,
and the raid ended successfully, for considerable booty was
captured, while of the four persons who escorted the caravan two
were made prisoners, one escaped, and one, &lsquo;Amr b. al-&#7716;a&#7693;rami,
was killed; he was the first person slain fighting against an
Islamic force. The violation of the sacred month seems to have
caused considerable scandal in Arabia, but led to no serious consequence;
on the other hand the shedding of blood created a feud
between the people of Mecca and the Refugees, with whom the
Meccans long declined to identify the people of Medina. The
fact that the man who had been killed was a client, not a citizen,
made no difference. The circumstance that booty had been
actually acquired appears to have helped the Prophet&rsquo;s cause
very considerably.</p>

<p>Both these consequences, the Meccan desire to avenge the
blood that had been shed and the anxiety of the Medinese to take
part in a successful raid, manifested themselves a few
months later, when an expedition was organized by
<span class="sidenote">Attack on Meccan Caravan.</span>
Mahomet to attack a caravan returning from Syria,
which had escaped him the previous year. Many desired to take
part in the raid, and finally some 300 persons were selected,
including a large number of &ldquo;Helpers.&rdquo; The leader of the
caravan learned somehow that an attack was being organized by
Mahomet on a large scale, and sent to Mecca for aid, while hurrying
home by forced marches. This is the first historical appearance
of Ab&#363; Sofi&#257;n (the leader of the caravan), who now for some
years played the part of president in the Meccan opposition to
Mahomet, and whose son was destined to found the second
Mahommedan dynasty (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Caliphate</a></span>, B). The day before the
battle to be fought at Badr, near the point where the northern
road leaves the coast to turn eastwards to Mecca, the Moslem
army learned that the Meccan succour (some 1000 strong) was
near, but that the caravan had escaped. The Meccans, it is
asserted, would have returned home now that their object was
secured, but the patrons of the man who had been killed in the
former raid were compelled to strike for vengeance.</p>

<p>The battle (Rama&#7693;&#257;n 19, <span class="scs">A.H.</span> 2, usually made to synchronize
with March 17, 624) ended in a complete victory for Mahomet,
whose followers killed seventy of the enemy and took seventy
prisoners&mdash;if we may trust what seem to be round numbers; it
was attributed by him to divine co-operation, taking the form of
an illusion wrought on the enemy, and the despatch of a regiment
of angels to the assistance of the Believers, while on the other
hand the treachery of the Devil did mischief to the Meccans.
The popular tradition attributed it to the prowess of some of
Mahomet&rsquo;s followers, especially his uncle &#7716;amza and his cousin
Ali. In the narratives which have come down and which seem
to be authentic the result is amply accounted for by the excellence
of the Moslem discipline and the complete absence of any on the
Meccan side. Mahomet himself is said to have fainted at the
first sight of blood, and to have remained during the battle in a
hut built for him to which swift camels were tied, to be used in
case of a defeat; yet these accounts make him responsible for
the tactics, whilst assigning the credit for the strategy to one
&#7716;obab b. al-Mondhir. Several of Mahomet&rsquo;s old enemies and
friends of Meccan days perished on this occasion; notably one
Abu Jahl, his uncle, but represented as an implacable enemy;
another hostile uncle, Abu Lahab, who is cursed in the Koran,
was not present but died shortly after the battle.</p>

<p>The day is called in the Koran by a Syriac expression the
&ldquo;Day of Deliverance,&rdquo; and both for internal and external politics
it was of incalculable advantage to Islam. The booty and the
ransoms of the prisoners provided the means for dealing with
distress; the story of supernatural aid soothed the feelings of the
defeated Meccans and had a tendency to disarm resistance elsewhere;
whilst Mahomet in the popularity acquired by his victory
was able to strike forcibly at his enemies in Medina. One of
the sequels to the victory was a series of assassinations whereby
critics of his actions were removed.</p>

<p>The defeat at Badr naturally led to efforts on the part of the
Meccans to avenge their dead and besides to secure the commerce,
by which they lived, from an enemy who was gradually
getting all the seaboard that lay between Jeddah
<span class="sidenote">The Taking of Mecca.</span>
and Yanbo within his sphere of influence; and the
year after Badr (<span class="scs">A.H.</span> 3) Ab&#363; Sofi&#257;n was able to lead a force
said to be three times as great as that which had been defeated,
and so numbering some 3000 men, against Medina itself; part
of it was under Kh&#257;lid b. al-Walid, one of the greatest of Arab
captains, afterwards conqueror of Syria. It is said that Mahomet&rsquo;s
plan was to remain in Medina itself, and leave it to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page406" id="page406"></a>406</span>
Meccan commander to discover some way of taking the place;
but that his hand was forced by his more ardent followers.
Others, however, assign this advice to Abdallah b. Ubayy, and
make the Prophet anxious to fight from the first. A battle was
in consequence fought under Mt U&#7717;ud (or Ohod), north-west of
Medina, wherein Kh&#257;lid succeeded in inflicting a severe defeat
on Mahomet&rsquo;s forces; his uncle &#7716;amza, hero of Badr, was killed
on this occasion. Fortunately for the Moslems, the Meccans
considered that they had finished their task when they discovered
that they had killed a number of the former equal to those who
had fallen at Badr on their own side; instead therefore of pursuing
their victory they went home. The immediate effect on Arabia
appears to have been to dissipate the illusion that the Prophet
could count on supernatural assistance in his wars; and we hear
of some blows being dealt him from outside. Meanwhile his relations
towards the Medinese Jews had grown more and more hostile,
and these are credited with doing their best to rouse the Meccans
to a sense of the danger which threatened them in the continuance
of the Prophet&rsquo;s power, and in general to stir up hostility
against him in Arabia. Whether this part was played by them
or not, in the fifth year of the Prophet&rsquo;s stay at Medina a fresh
invasion of the territory took place by a vast confederate force
of Meccans with their allies, the tribes Fazarah, Asad, Murrah,
&amp;c., to the number, it is said, of 10,000. This time the intention
of the leaders was undoubtedly to stamp out Islam. For the
first time in Arab warfare Mahomet resorted to the expedient
of defending his city by a trench, called by a Persian name, and
suggested by a Persian convert. But he also employed agents
to sow dissension among the confederates, and succeeded with
this no less than with the other expedient. After a brief stay,
and scarcely striking a blow, the confederacy dispersed, leaving
the Jews who still remained in Medina to the summary vengeance
of the Prophet. The want of records written from the Meccan
standpoint renders the abortiveness of this last attempt at
storming the Prophet&rsquo;s stronghold scarcely intelligible.</p>

<p>From this time, however, the road towards the eventual taking
of Mecca became easy, and we are told that such was the importance
attached to that city throughout Arabia that its acquisition
meant for the Prophet the acquisition of the whole peninsula.
The next year (<span class="scs">A.H.</span> 6) he deemed it advisable to make a truce
with the Meccans (the Truce of &#7716;odaibiyah), whereby he secured
for his followers the right of performing the pilgrimage in the
following year; on this occasion he even consented to forgo his
title &ldquo;Prophet of Allah,&rdquo; when the Meccans refused to sign a
deed in which it was employed, greatly to the scandal of his more
earnest followers, including Omar; they were however too deeply
committed to Islam to be able to defy the Prophet. When the
pilgrimage was performed (<span class="scs">A.H.</span> 7), Mahomet not only won
important converts in the persons of Kh&#257;lid and the no less
able &lsquo;Amr b. al-&lsquo;A&#7779;, but in general impressed the population
with the idea that his was the winning side. An excuse was easily
found for invading Mecca itself in the following year, when Ab&#363;
Sofi&#257;n took the opportunity of embracing Islam before it was too
late. Very little resistance was now made by the Meccans,
whose chiefs were already in Mahomet&rsquo;s camp, and Mahomet
used his victory with great moderation; his proscription list
was finally reduced to two. The theory that all offences were
cancelled by conversion was loyally observed. Moreover the
Prophet incurred the displeasure of his Medinese friends by the
anxiety which he displayed to soothe the feelings of his former
enemies and antagonists. The Medinese, however, prevailed
upon him to maintain their city as his political capital,
while making Mecca the religious centre of his system; and
this arrangement accounts perhaps more than anything else
for the persistence of the system amid so many dynastic
changes.</p>

<p>In the main he appears to have introduced little alteration
into the government of Mecca, and it is said that he even declined
to retaliate on those who had confiscated the possessions of the
Refugees. Even the Ka&lsquo;ba was left in the keeping of its former
custodian, though of course its interior as well as its precincts
were cleansed of all that could offend monotheists. In the
following year the pilgrimage was for the first time conducted by
a Moslem official, Ab&#363; Bekr. A proclamation was made on that
occasion, forbidding idolaters in future to take part in the pilgrimage,
and giving all Arabs who were not as yet converted
four months&rsquo; grace before force was to be brought to bear upon
them. In the following year Mahomet conducted the Pilgrimage
himself. This solemn occasion (the &ldquo;Farewell Pilgrimage&rdquo;)
was also employed for the delivery of an important proclamation,
wherein the Prophet declared that God had completed their
religion. The principle whereon he specially insisted was the
brotherhood of Islam; but there is some difficulty in enucleating
the original sermon from later additions.</p>

<p>It would seem that Mahomet&rsquo;s enterprise originally comprised
the conversion of Mecca only, and that he thought of himself
as sent to his fellow-citizens only, as had been the
case with earlier prophets, whose message was for
<span class="sidenote">Conquest of Arabia.</span>
their &ldquo;brethren.&rdquo; His views took a somewhat
different direction after his brief exile to &#7788;&#257;if, and the conquest
of Arabia was in a way forced upon him in the course of his
struggle with the Meccans. It is not indeed perfectly clear by
what process he arrived at the resolution to exclude paganism
from Arabia; at first he appears to have tolerated it at Medina,
and in some of his earlier contracts with neighbouring tribes he
is represented as allowing it, though some of our texts make him
reserve to himself the right of enforcing Islam if he chose; only
the Meccans were at first, according to the most authentic
documents, excluded from all truce or treaty. At the battle of
Badr he appears to have formulated the rule that no one might
fight on his side who had not embraced Islam; and when once
he had won fame as a successful campaigner, those who wished
to share his adventures had to pass the Islamic test. After the
battle of Uhud (Ohod) we hear of a tribe demanding missionaries
to instruct them in Islamic principles; and though in the case
recorded the demand was treacherous, the idea of sending missionaries
appears not to have been unfamiliar even then, albeit
the number sent (70), if rightly recorded, implies that the Prophet
suspected the good faith of the applicants. After the taking of
Mecca, whereby the chief sanctuary at any rate of north Arabia
had been cleared of all idolatrous associations, and consecrated
to monotheism, paganism in general was conscious of being
attacked; and the city had scarcely been brought under the
new régime before the Prophet had to face a confederation of
tribes called Haw&#257;zin and Thaq&#299;f. The battle which ensued,
known as the Day of Honain, was near ending disastrously for
Islam; some of Mahomet&rsquo;s sturdiest followers fled; but the
terrible danger of a defeat in the neighbourhood of recently
conquered Mecca roused the Prophet and Ali to heroism, and they
saved the day. Emissaries were now sent far and wide demanding
the destruction of idols, and only &#7788;&#257;if appears to have made
any considerable resistance; against this place for the first time
the Prophet made use of siege artillery, such as was employed by
the Byzantines; though compelled by the bravery of the inhabitants
to raise the siege, he was afterwards able to take the city
by capitulation. It has been observed that here only do we
read of much attachment to the old deities; in most places they
were discarded with few regrets when once their impotence had
been found out. After the taking of Mecca and the victory of
Honain there appears to have been a general desire, extending
even to the extreme south of Arabia, to make the best terms with
the conqueror so soon as possible; iconoclasm became general.
Flatterers of various kinds, including poets, came to seek the
favour of the sovereign; and a mock war of words appears to
have been substituted by some tribes for more serious fighting,
to terminate in surrender. For warfare of his sort Mahomet
had a powerful helper in the poet &#7716;&#257;ssan b. Th&#257;bit, for whose
effusions a pulpit was erected in the Medina mosque, and whose
verses were said to be inspired by the Holy Spirit; though, as
has been seen, Mahomet was not himself able to judge of their
artistic merit. It was not, however, found easy to enforce the
payment of the alms on these new converts; and this taxation
caused an almost general revolt so soon as Mahomet&rsquo;s death had
been ascertained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page407" id="page407"></a>407</span></p>

<p>Although the central portions of the peninsula in Mahomet&rsquo;s
time were practically independent, large portions of the north-west
and south-east were provinces of the Byzantine
and Persian empires respectively, whence any scheme
<span class="sidenote">Plan of World-conquest.</span>
for the conquest of Arabia would necessarily involve
the conqueror in war with these great powers. The conquest of
Persia is said to have been contemplated by the Prophet as
early as <span class="scs">A.H.</span> 5, when the famous Trench was being dug; but it was
not till the year <span class="scs">A.H.</span> 7, on the eve of the taking of Mecca, that
the Prophet conceived the idea of sending missives to all known
sovereigns and potentates, promising them safety if, but only if,
they embraced Islam. The text of these letters, which only
varied in the name of the person addressed, is preserved (doubtless
faithfully) by the Moslem Oral Tradition; in the middle of
the last century a French explorer professed to discover in Egypt
the original of one of them&mdash;addressed to the mysterious personage
called the Muqauqis (Mu&#7731;au&#7731;is) of Egypt&mdash;and this, it appears,
is still preserved amid other supposed relics of the Prophet in
Constantinople, though there is little reason for believing it to
be genuine. The anecdotes dealing with the reception of these
letters by their addressees are all fabulous in character. Two
appear to have sent favourable replies: the king of Axum, who
now could send the exiles whom he had so long harboured to
their successful master; and the Egyptian governor, who sent
Mahomet a valuable present, including two Coptic women for
his harem. The emperor Heraclius is claimed as a secret convert
to Islam, on whom pressure had to be put by his advisers to
conceal his convictions. The Persian king is said to have sent
orders to have Mahomet arrested; his messengers arrived in
Medina, but were unable to carry out the commands of their
master, who died while they were there. Two of the letters are
said to have had important results. One was addressed to the
Himyarite chiefs (called by the south Arabian appellation <i>qail</i>)
in Yemen, and effected their conversion; another to the governor
of Bostra in Roman Arabia, who put the bearer of this insolent
message to death; a force was despatched by Mahomet immediately
afterwards (beginning of <span class="scs">A.H.</span> 8) to avenge this outrage;
and though the Moslems were defeated in their first encounter
with the Byzantine forces at Mutah, they appear to have given
a good account of themselves; it was here that Ja&lsquo;far, cousin of
the Prophet, met his death. In <span class="scs">A.H.</span> 9 a successful expedition
was led by the Prophet himself northward, in which, though
no Byzantine force was encountered, a considerable region was
withdrawn from the Byzantine sphere of influence, and made
either Islamic or tributary to Islam. At the time of his death
(of fever, after a short illness) he was organizing an expedition
for the conquest of Syria.</p>

<p>The Prophet claimed throughout that his revelation confirmed
the Jewish and Christian Scriptures, and this claim is on the
whole reasonable, though his acquaintance with both
was in the highest degree vague and inaccurate.
<span class="sidenote">Jewish and Christian Communities.</span>
Still he reproduced the Old Testament as faithfully
as he could, and though he patriotically endeavours
to shed some lustre on his supposed ancestor Ishmael, he does not
appear to have questioned the Biblical theory according to which
the founder of the north Arabian nations was the son of a slave
girl. On neither the truth of the Biblical history and miracles nor
the validity of the Mosaic legislation does he appear to have cast
any doubt. He even allows that Israel was the chosen people.
The Gospel was known to him chiefly through apocryphal and
heretical sources, which cannot certainly be identified; but he
accepted the doctrine of the Virgin-birth, the miracles of healing
the sick and raising the dead, and the ascension; the crucifixion
and resurrection were clearly denied by the sect from whom he
had received his information, and rejected by him, though
certainly not because of any miracle which the latter involved.
His quarrel with the Jews at Medina appears to have been by no
means of his own seeking, but to have arisen unavoidably, owing
to his particular view of his office being such as they could not
accept; and his attempt to discredit, not the Mosaic Law, but
the form in which they presented it, was an expedient to which
he resorted in self-defence. An attempt was made shortly after
his arrival at Medina to settle the relations between the two
communities by a treaty, according to which, while their equality
was guaranteed there should be little interference between the
two; this, however, was found unworkable, and each victory of
Mahomet over the Meccans was followed by violent measures
against the Medinese Israelites. When experience had shown
him their military incompetence he appears to have been unable
to resist the temptation to appropriate their goods for the benefit
of his followers; and his attack on the flourishing Jewish settlement
of Khaibar, after the affair of &#7716;odaibiyah, appears to have
been practically unprovoked, and designed to satisfy his discontented
adherents by an accession of plunder. Yet the consciousness
that this process was economically wasteful suggested to him
an idea which Islamic states are only now abandoning, viz.
that of a tolerated caste, who should till the soil and provide
sustenance for the Believers who were to be the fighting caste.
Whereas then his former plan in dealing with Israelites had been
to banish or massacre, he now left the former owners of Khaibar
(who had survived the capture of the place) in possession of the
soil, of whose produce they were to pay a fixed proportion to
the Islamic state. The same principle was adopted in the case
of later conquests of Jewish settlements.</p>

<p>Disputes with Christians occur somewhat later in the Prophet&rsquo;s
career than those with Jews, for neither at Mecca nor Medina were
the former to be found in any numbers; individuals are likely
to have been found in both cities, and we hear of one Medinese
&ldquo;Abu&rsquo;Amir the Monk,&rdquo; who after Mahomet&rsquo;s arrival at Medina
branded him as an impostor, and, going himself into exile, made
many an abortive attempt to discredit and injure Mahomet&rsquo;s
cause. The notices of him are meagre and obscure. Mahomet&rsquo;s
manifesto to the world, about the time of the taking of Khaibar,
appears to represent his definite breach with Christianity; and
when in the &ldquo;year of the embassies&rdquo; the Christians of Najran
sent a deputation to him, they found that the breach between
the two systems was not to be healed. Of the three alternatives
open to them&mdash;conversion, internecine war, and tribute, they
chose the last. The Christian tribes of north Arabia showed
greater inclination towards the first. The Prophet&rsquo;s policy was to
give Christians lighter terms than Jews, and though the Koran
reflects the gradual adoption by the Prophet of an attitude of
extreme hostility to both systems, its tone is on the whole
far more friendly to the former than to the latter. Some other
communities are mentioned in the Koran, but merely in casual
allusions: thus we know that Mahomet&rsquo;s sympathy was with the
Byzantines in their struggle with Persia, but in his most tolerant
utterance the Magians or Mazdians as well as the Sabians
(with whom his followers were identified by the Meccans) are
mentioned with respect.</p>

<p>The financial requirements of Mahomet&rsquo;s state were of the
simplest kind, for there is no trace of any form of governmental
department having been instituted by him, even
when he was master of the peninsula; nor can we
<span class="sidenote">Mahomet&rsquo;s Administration.</span>
name any permanent officials in his employ except
his <i>muaddhin</i> Bilal, and perhaps his court-poet Hass&#257;n. A staff
of scribes was finally required both to take down his revelations
and to conduct correspondence; but although he encouraged the
acquisition of penmanship (indeed some of the prisoners at Badr
are said to have been allowed to ransom themselves by teaching
it to the Medinese), we know of no regular secretaries in his
employ. As despot of Medina he combined the functions of
legislator, administrator, general and judge; his duties in the
last three capacities were occasionally delegated to others, as
when he appointed a governor of Medina during his absence, or
leaders for expeditions, with provision for successors in case
of their falling, but we hear of no permanent or regular delegation
of them. Till near the end of his career at Medina he
maintained the principle that migration to that city was a condition
of conversion; but when, owing to the extension of his
power, this was no longer practicable, his plan was in the main
to leave the newly converted communities to manage their internal
affairs as before, only sending occasional envoys to discharge
special duties, especially instruction in the Koran and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page408" id="page408"></a>408</span>
the principles of Islam, and to collect the Alms; quite towards
the end of his life he appears to have sent persons to the provinces
to act as judges, with instructions to judge according to the
Koran, and where that failed, <i>the practice</i> (<i>sunna</i>), <i>i.e.</i> the practice
of the community, for which a later generation substituted the
practice of the Prophet. There were, therefore, no regular
payments to permanent officials; and the taxation called <i>Alms</i>,
which developed into an income-tax, but was at first a demand
for voluntary contributions, was wholly for the support of the
poor Moslems; it might not be used for the maintenance of the
state, <i>i.e.</i> Mahomet and his family. For them, and for public
business, <i>e.g.</i> the purchase of war material and gratuities to
visitors, provision was made out of the booty, of which Mahomet
claimed one-fifth (the chieftain&rsquo;s share had previously, we are
told, been one-fourth), while the remainder&mdash;or at least the bulk
of it&mdash;was distributed among the fighting men; the Prophet
appears to have prided himself on the justice of his distribution
on these occasions, and doubtless won popularity thereby,
though we hear occasionally of grumbling; for difficulties occurred
when a defeated tribe embraced Islam, and so could claim equality
with their conquerors, or when portions of the spoil were
irregularly employed by Mahomet to allay resentment: the
persons whose allegiance was thus purchased were euphemistically
termed &ldquo;those whose hearts were united.&rdquo; What afterwards
proved the main source of revenue in Islamic states
dates from the taking of Khaibar; for the rent paid to the state
by tolerated communities for the right to work their land
developed long after Mahomet&rsquo;s time into a poll-tax for Unbelievers
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Caliphate</a></span>, <i>e.g.</i> B. § 8 and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mahommedan Institutions</a></span>),
and a land-tax for all owners of land. Immediately after
the taking of Khaibar certain communities, of which the most
notable was Fadak, sent tribute before they had been attacked
and reduced; their land was regarded by Mahomet as his
private domain, but after his death it was withdrawn from his
heirs by his successor Ab&#363; Bekr, in virtue of a maxim that
Prophets left no inheritance, which in the opinion of F&#257;&#7789;ima
was contrary to Koranic doctrine, and invented by Ayesha&rsquo;s
father expressly for the purpose of excluding her and her husband
from their rights; and this is likely to have been the case.</p>

<p>As a military organizer Mahomet, as has been seen, was
anxious to adopt the most advanced of contemporary methods,
and more than once is said to have scandalized the Arabs by
foreign innovations, as at a later time the Moslem chiefs who
first used gunpowder scandalized their co-religionists. The
unit in his armies seems to have been, as of old, the tribe,
under its natural leader; that he introduced no more scientific
division, and nothing like a hierarchy of officers was perhaps
due to the difficulty of reconciling such a system with the equality
of all Moslems.</p>

<p>As has been seen, the Koran only assumed the character of
a civil code as the need for one arose; and for some time after
Mahomet&rsquo;s arrival at Medina old-fashioned methods of settling
disputes continued in use, and doubtless in accordance with
precedent where such was known. For difficult cases, even in
Arab opinion, divine inspiration was required; and since Mahomet
naturally claimed to be in sole enjoyment of this, his utterances
soon became the unique source of law, though he did not at first
think of organizing a code. Such a plan is said to have occurred
to him, and he even wished to dictate a code upon his deathbed;
but his friends supposed or professed to suppose him to be
delirious. A table regulating the &ldquo;Alms&rdquo; was left by him, it is
said, in the possession of Ab&#363; Bekr; but other traditions assign
another origin to this document.</p>

<p>Just as there were no regular officials for the arrangement of
business, so there were none for its execution; when punishment
was to be administered, any follower of Mahomet might be called
upon to administer it. In the case of the massacre of the
Ban&#363; Qurai&#7827;ah care was taken to see that some of the heads
were struck off by their former allies, in order that the latter
might be unable at any time to bring a demand for vengeance.
The Prophet hoped by the mere terror of his name to make
complete security reign throughout Arabia, and there is no
evidence that any system of policing either it or even Medina
occurred to him.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Until the death of Khadija the Prophet&rsquo;s private life seems to have
been normal and happy, for though the loss of his sons in infancy is
said to have earned him a contemptuous epithet, he was
fortunate in his adoption of Zaid b. &#7716;arithah, apparently
<span class="sidenote">Domestic Life.</span>
a prisoner ransomed by Khadija or one of her relatives,
who appears as dutiful almost to excess and competent in affairs.
The marriages of his daughters seem all to have been happy, with,
curiously, the exception of that between Fatima and Ali. His
domestic troubles, to which an unreasonable amount of space seems
to be devoted, even in the Koran, began after the Migration, when,
probably in the main for political reasons, he instituted a royal
harem. One of these political motives was the principle which long
survived, that the conquest of a state was consummated by possession
of the former monarch&rsquo;s wife, or daughter; another, as has been
seen, the desire to obtain the securest possible hold on his ministers.
In his marriage with the daughter of his arch-enemy Ab&#363; Sofi&#257;n,
before the latter&rsquo;s conversion, we can see a combination of the two.
Few, therefore, of these marriages occasioned scandal; yet public
morality seemed to be violated when the Prophet took to himself
the wife of his adopted son Zaid, whose name has in consequence
the honour of mention in the Koran in the revelation which was
delivered in defence of this act. Its purpose was, according to this,
to establish the difference between adoptive and real filiation.
Serious trouble was occasioned by a charge of adultery brought
against the youthful favourite Ayesha, and this had to be refuted
by a special revelation; the charge, which was backed up apparently
by Ali, seems to have been connected with some deeper scheme for
causing dissension between the Prophet and his friends. Yet another
revelation is concerned with a mutiny in the harem organized
by Omar&rsquo;s daughter Hafsa, owing to undue favour shown to a
Coptic concubine (Mary, mother of a son called Ibrahim, who died
in infancy; his death was marked by an eclipse, January 27, 632);
and various details of factions within the harem are told us by
Mahomet&rsquo;s biographers.</p>

<p>Of the members of this harem the only prominent one is Ayesha,
married to the Prophet shortly after the Flight, when she had scarcely
passed the period of infancy, but who appears to have been gifted
with astuteness and ambition that were quite beyond her years, and
who maintained her ascendancy over the Prophet in spite of the fact
that many carping criticisms of his revelations are attributed to her.
Some of this may have been due to the obligations (including pecuniary
obligations) under which her father had laid Mahomet; but her
reputation seems to have been greatly enhanced by the sending down
of a revelation to exonerate her (<span class="scs">A.H.</span> 6), for which she thanked God
and not the Prophet. Each accession to the harem rendered the
building of a house or room necessary for the newcomer&rsquo;s accommodation;
a fact in which Robertson Smith perhaps rightly saw a
relic of the older system whereby the tent was the property of women.
The trouble noticed above seems to have arisen from the want of
a similar arrangement in the case of slave girls, with whom Mahomet&rsquo;s
system permits cohabitation. When Mahomet, whether in consequence
of the fatigue incurred by the &ldquo;Farewell Pilgrimage,&rdquo; or,
as others thought, by the working of some poison put into his food
some years before by a Jewess of Khaibar, was attacked by the illness
which proved fatal, it was to the house of Ayesha that he was transferred
(from that of another wife) to be nursed; and he apparently
died in the arms of the favourite, on whose statements we have to
rely for what we know of his last hours.</p>

<p>The traditional description of Mahomet is &ldquo;of middle height,
greyish, with hair that was neither straight nor curly; with a large
head, large eyes, heavy eyelashes, reddish tint in the
eyes, thick-bearded, broad-shouldered, with thick hands
<span class="sidenote">General Characteristics.</span>
and feet&rdquo;; he was in the habit of giving violent expression
to the emotions of anger and mirth. The supposition
that he at any time suffered from physical weakness seems
absolutely refuted by his career as a leader of difficult, dangerous
and wearisome expeditions, from his migration to Medina until his
death; indeed, during his last years he exhibited a capacity for both
physical and intellectual activity which implies a high degree of both
health and strength; and without these the previous struggle at
Mecca could scarcely have been carried on. The supposition that
he was liable to fits (epileptic or cataleptic) was intended to account
for certain of the phenomena supposed to accompany the delivery
of revelations; some of these however rest on very questionable
authority: and the greater number of the revelations give evidence
of careful preparation rather than spontaneity.</p>

<p>The literary matter ascribed to the Prophet consists of (1) the
Koran (<i>q.v.</i>); (2) certain contracts, letters and rescripts preserved
by his biographers; (3) a number of sayings on a vast variety of
topics, collected by traditionalists. The references in the Koran
to a form of literature called &ldquo;Wisdom&rdquo; (<i>&#7717;ikmah</i>) suggest that even
in the Prophet&rsquo;s time some attempts had been made to collect or at
least preserve some of the last; the general uncertainty of oral tradition
and the length of time which elapsed before any critical treatment
of it was attempted, and the variety of causes, creditable and discreditable,
which led to the wilful fabrication of prophetic utterances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page409" id="page409"></a>409</span>
render the use to which No. 3 can be put very limited. Thus
the lengthy description of the journey to heaven which Sprenger was
inclined to accept as genuine is regarded by most critics as a later
fabrication. It is very much to be regretted that the number of <i>pièces
justificatives</i> (No. 2) quoted by the biographers is so small, and that
for these oral tradition was preferred to a search for the actual
documents, some of which may well have been in existence when
the earliest biographies were written. Their style appears to have
been plain and straightforward, though the allusions which they
contain are not always intelligible.</p>

<p>In his personal relations with men Mahomet appears to have been
able to charm and impress in an extraordinary degree, whence we
find him able to control persons like Omar and Khalid, who appear
to have been self-willed and masterful, and a single interview seems
to have been sufficient to turn many an enemy into a devoted
adherent. Cases (perhaps legendary) are quoted of his being able
by a look or a word to disarm intending assassins.</p>

<p>Although the titles which he took were religious in character, and
his office might not be described as sovereignty, his interests appear
to have lain far more in the building up and maintenance of empire
than in ecclesiastical matters. Thus only can we account for the
violent and sudden changes which he introduced into his system,
for his temporary lapse into paganism, and for his ultimate adoption
of the cult of the Black Stone, which, it is said, gave offence to some
of his sincere adherents (<i>e.g.</i> Omar), and seems hard to reconcile with
his tirades against fetish-worship. The same is indicated by his
remarkable doctrine that the utterance of the creed constituted a
Moslem and not its cordial acceptance, and his practice of at times
buying adhesion. Even an historian so favourable to the Prophet
as Prince Caetani recognizes that ultimately what he regarded as
most important was that his subjects should pay their taxes. And
in general his system was not favourable to fanaticism (<i>al-ghul&#363;
fi&lsquo;l-d&#299;n</i>); he repeatedly gave permission for concealment of faith when
the profession of it was dangerous; he took care to avoid institutions
which, like the Jewish Sabbath, interfered seriously with military
expeditions and the conduct of business, and permitted considerable
irregularity in the matters of prayer and fasting when circumstances
rendered it desirable. In his theory that Koranic texts could be
abrogated he made wise provision against the danger of hasty legislation,
though some of its usefulness was frustrated by his failure to
provide for such abrogation after his death.</p>
</div>

<p>As has been seen, Mahomet claimed to introduce a wholly new
dispensation, and a maxim of his law is that Islam cancels all
that preceded it, except, indeed, pecuniary debts; it is
not certain that even this exception always held good.
<span class="sidenote">Mahomet&rsquo;s Reforms.</span>
Hence his system swept away a number of practices
(chiefly connected with the camel) that were associated with
pagan superstitions. The most celebrated of these is the arrow-game,
a form of gambling for shares in slaughtered camels, to
which poetic allusions are very frequent. More important than
this was his attitude towards the blood-feud, or system of tribal
responsibility for homicide (whether intentional or accidental),
whereby one death regularly led to protracted wars, it being
considered dishonourable to take blood-money (usually in the
form of camels) or to be satisfied with one death in exchange.
This system he endeavoured to break down, chiefly by sinking
all earlier tribal distinctions in the new brotherhood of Islam;
but also by limiting the vengeance to be demanded to such as
was no more than the equivalent of the offence committed, and
by urging the acceptance of money-compensation instead, or
complete forgiveness of the offence. The remembrance of pre-Islamic
quarrels was visited by him with condign punishment
on those who had embraced Islam; and though it was long before
the tribal system quite broke down, even in the great cities which
rose in the new provinces, and the old state of things seems to
have quickly been resumed in the desert, his legislation on this
subject rendered orderly government among Arabs possible.</p>

<p>Next in importance to this is the abolition of infanticide,
which is condemned even in early Suras of the Koran. The
scanty notices which we have of the practice are not altogether
consistent; at times we are told that it was confined to certain
tribes, and consisted in the burying alive of infant daughters; at
other times it is extended to a wider area, and said to have been
carried out on males as well as females. After the taking of Mecca
this prohibition was included among the conditions of Islam.</p>

<p>In the laws relating to women it seems likely that he regulated
current practice rather than introduced much that was actually
new, though, as has been seen, he is credited with giving them the
right to inherit property; the most precise legislation in the Koran
deals with this subject, of which the main principle is that the
share of the male equals that of two females. Our ignorance of
the precise nature of the marriage customs prevalent in Arabia
at the rise of Islam renders it difficult to estimate the extent to
which his laws on this subject were an improvement on what
had been before. The pre-Islamic family, unless our records
are wholly misleading, did not differ materially from the Islamic;
in both polygamy and concubinage were recognized and normal;
and it is uncertain that the text which is supposed to limit the
number of wives to four was intended to have that meaning.
The &ldquo;condition of Islam&rdquo; whereby adultery was forbidden is
said to have been ridiculed at the time, on the ground that this
practice had never been approved. Yet it would seem that
certain forms of promiscuity had been tolerated, though the
subject is obscure. Against these services we must set the
abrogation of some valuable practices. His unfortunate essay
in astronomy, whereby a calendar of twelve lunar months,
bearing no relation to the seasons, was introduced, was in any
case a retrograde step; but it appears to have been connected
with the abrogation of the sanctity of the four months during
which raiding had been forbidden in Arabia, which, as has
been seen, he was the first to violate. He also, as has been
noticed, permitted himself a slight amount of bloodshed in
Mecca itself, and that city perhaps never quite recovered its
sacrosanct character. Of more serious consequences for the
development of the community was his encouragement of the
shedding of kindred blood in the cause of Islam; the consequences
of the abrogation of this taboo seem to have been felt for a great
length of time. His assassinations of enemies were afterwards
quoted as precedents in books of Tradition. No less unfortunate
was the recognition of the principle whereby atonement could be
made for oaths. On the question how far the seclusion of
women was enjoined or countenanced by him different views
have been held.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Besides the contemporary documents enumerated above (Koranic
texts, rescripts and authentic traditions) many of the events were
celebrated by poets, whose verses were ostensibly incorporated
in the standard biography of Ibn Is&#7717;&#257;q; in
<span class="sidenote">Sources.</span>
the abridgment of that biography which we possess many of these
are obelized as spurious, and, indeed, what we know of the procedure
of those who professed to collect early poetry gives us little confidence
in the genuineness of such odes. A few, however, seem to stand
criticism, and the <i>diwan</i> (or collection of poems) attributed to &#7716;assan
b. Th&#257;bit is ordinarily regarded as his. Though they rarely give
detailed descriptions of events, their attestation is at times of value,
<i>e.g.</i> for the story that the bodies of the slain at Badr were cast by the
Prophet into a pit. Besides this, the narratives of eyewitnesses
of important events, or of those who had actually taken part in them,
were eagerly sought by the second generation, and some of these
were committed to writing well before the end of the 1st century.
The practice instituted by the second Caliph, of assigning pensions
proportioned to the length of time in which the recipient had been
a member of the Islamic community, led to the compilation of certain
rolls, and to the accurate preservation of the main sequence of events
from the commencement of the mission, and for the detailed sequence
after the Flight, which presently became an era (beginning with the
first month of the year in which the Flight took place). The procedure
whereby the original dates of the events (so far as they were
remembered) were translated into the Moslem calendar&mdash;for something
of this sort must have been done&mdash;is unknown, and is unlikely
to have been scientific.</p>

<p>Mahomet&rsquo;s conduct being made the standard of right and wrong,
there was little temptation to &ldquo;whitewash&rdquo; him, although the
original biography by Ibn Is&#7717;&#257;q appears to have contained details
which the author of the abridgment omitted as scandalous. The
preservation of so much that was historical left little room for the
introduction of miraculous narrations; these therefore either belong
to the obscure period of his life or can be easily eliminated; thus the
narratives of the Meccan council at which the assassination of
Mahomet was decided, of the battles of Badr, U&#7717;ud and &#7716;onain, and
the death of Sad&lsquo;b. Mu &lsquo;adh, would lose nothing by the omission of
the angels and the devil, though a certain part is assigned the one
or the other on all these occasions. We should have expected
biographies which were published when the &lsquo;Abbasids were reigning
to have falsified history for the purpose of glorifying &lsquo;Abb&#257;s, their
progenitor; the very small extent to which this expectation is justified
is a remarkable testimony to their general trustworthiness.</p>

<p><i>Modern Authorities.</i>&mdash;The critical study of the Life of Mahomet begins
in Europe with the publication by Th. Gagnier in 1723 of the Life
by Abulfeda (<i>q.v.</i>). Presently there appeared an apologetic biography
by Henri Cmte. de Boulainvilliers (2nd ed., Amsterdam, 1731), to
which Gagnier replied in 1732 (<i>La Vie de Mahomet, traduite</i>, &amp;c. ibid.).
The next considerable advance in the treatment of the subject is
marked by the biography of G. Weil (<i>Muhammed der Prophet</i>,
Stuttgart, 1843), which is wholly without religious bias; the popular
life by Washington Irving (London, 1849) is based on this. That
by J. L. Merrick (the <i>Life and Religion of Mohammed</i>, Boston, U.S.A.,
1850) rests on Shi&lsquo;ite sources. The search for MSS. in India conducted
by A. Sprenger led to the discovery of fresh material, which
was utilized by Sprenger himself in his unfinished <i>Life of Mohammad</i>
(Pt. 1, Allahabad, 1851), and his more elaborate <i>Das Leben und die
Lehre des Mohammad</i> (Berlin, 1861-1865), and by Sir William Muir
in his <i>Life of Mahomet</i>, (London, 1858-1861) 4 vols.: afterwards
abridged in one volume and reprinted. These are still the standard
treatises on the subject; the pro-Christian bias of Muir is very marked,
while Sprenger has hazarded numerous conjectures on subjects
with which he had little familiarity. The biography by S. W.
Koelle, <i>Mohammed and Mohammedanism</i> (London, 1889), is pro-Christian,
the popular work of Syed Ameer Ali <i>The Spirit of Islam</i>,
(London, 1896) an apology for Mahommedanism. Later treatises,
resting on original authorities, are those by H. Grimme <i>Mohamed</i>,
(Münster, 1892, and Munich, 1904), F. Buhl, <i>Mohameds Liv</i> (Copenhagen,
1903&mdash;Danish: since translated into German), D. S. Margoliouth
<i>Mohammed and the Rise of Islam</i> (N.Y., 1905, &amp;c.), and Prince
Caetani <i>Annali del Islam</i>, i. ii. (Milan, 1905-1907). For the direction
of public opinion in Mahomet&rsquo;s favour the Lecture on <i>The Hero as
Prophet</i> in Carlyle&rsquo;s <i>Heroes and Hero-worship</i> (London, 1846) was
singularly effective; his views were enforced by R. Bosworth Smith
<i>Mohammed and Mohammedanism</i>, (London, 1873, &amp;c.). A somewhat
similar line was taken in France by J. Barthélémy Saint-Hilaire,
<i>Mahomet et le Coran</i>, (Paris, 1865), while the <i>Vie de Mahomet
d&rsquo;après la Tradition</i> of E. Lamairesse and G. Dujarric (Paris, 1897)
is written entirely from the Moslem standpoint.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAHOMMED AHMED IBN SEYYID ABDULLAH<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span> (1848-1885),
Sudanese tyrant, known as &ldquo;the Mahdi,&rdquo; was born in Dongola.
His family, known as excellent boat-builders, claimed to be
<i>Ashraf</i> (or <i>Sherifs</i>), <i>i.e.</i> descendants of Mahomet. His father
was a <i>fiki</i> or religious teacher, and Mahommed Ahmed devoted
himself early to religious studies. When about twenty years old
he went to live on Abba Island on the White Nile about 150 m.
above Khartum. He first acquired fame by a quarrel with the
head of the brotherhood which he had joined, Mahommed asserting
that his master condoned transgression of the divine law.
After this incident many dervishes (religious mendicants)
gathered round the young sheikh, whose reputation for sanctity
speedily grew. He travelled secretly through Kordofan, where
(with ample justification) he denounced to the villagers the extortion
of the tax-gatherer and told of the coming of the mahdi
who should deliver them from the oppressor. He also wrote a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page411" id="page411"></a>411</span>
pamphlet summoning true believers to purify their religion
from the defilements of the &ldquo;Turks&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the Egyptian officials
and all non-native inhabitants of the Sudan. The influence he
gained at length aroused the anxiety of the authorities, and in
May 1881 a certain Abu Saud, a notorious scoundrel, was sent
to Abba Island to bring the sheikh to Khartum. Abu Saud&rsquo;s
mission failed, and Mahommed Ahmed no longer hesitated to
call himself al-Mahdi al Montasir, &ldquo;The Expected Guide.&rdquo; In
August he defeated another force sent to Abba Island to arrest
him, but thereafter deemed it prudent to retire to Jebel Gedir,
in the Nuba country south of Kordofan, where he was soon at
the head of a powerful force; and 6000 Egyptian troops under
Yusef Pasha, advancing from Fashoda, were nearly annihilated
in June 1882. By the end of 1882 the whole of the Sudan south
of Khartum was in rebellion, with the exception of the Bahr-el-Ghazal
and the Equatorial Provinces. In January 1883 El
Obeid, the capital of Kordofan, was captured. In the November
following Hicks Pasha&rsquo;s force of 10,000 men was destroyed at
Kashgil, and in the same year the mahdi&rsquo;s lieutenant, Osman
Digna, raised the tribes in the eastern Sudan, and besieged
Sinkat and Tokar, near Suakin, routing General Valentine
Baker&rsquo;s force of 2500 men at El Teb in February 1884. The
operations undertaken by Great Britain in face of this state
of affairs are narrated under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Egypt</a></span>: <i>Military Operations</i>.
It need only be added that General Gordon (<i>q.v.</i>) was besieged
at Khartum by the mahdi and was killed there when the town
was captured by the mahdists on the 25th-26th of January 1885.
The mahdi himself died at Omdurman a few months later
(June 22, 1885), and was succeeded in power by his khalifa
Abdullah.</p>

<p>When he announced his divine mission Mahommed Ahmed
adopted the Shi&lsquo;ite traditions concerning the mahdi, and thus
put himself in opposition to the sultan of Turkey as the only
true commander of the faithful. To emphasize his position the
mahdi struck coins in his own name and set himself to suppress
all customs introduced by the &ldquo;Turks.&rdquo; His social and
religious reforms are contained in various proclamations, one of
which is drawn up in the form of ten commandments. They
concern, chiefly, such matters as ritual, prayers, soberness in food
and raiment, the cost of marriage and the behaviour of women.
How far the mahdi was the controller of the movement which
he started cannot be known, but from the outset of his public
career his right-hand man was a Baggara tribesman named
Abdullah (the khalifa), who became his successor, and after his
flight to Jebel Gedir the mahdi was largely dependent for his
support on Baggara sheikhs, who gratified one of his leading
tastes by giving him numbers of their young women. In the
few months between the fall of Khartum and his death the mahdi,
relieved from the incessant strain of toil, copied in his private
life all the vices of Oriental despots while maintaining in public
the austerity he demanded of his followers. His death is variously
attributed to disease and to poisoning by a woman of his
harem. On the occupation of Omdurman by the British (Sept.
1898) the mahdi&rsquo;s tomb was destroyed, his body burnt and the
ashes thrown into the Nile (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sudan</a></span>: <i>Anglo-Egyptian</i>).</p>

proclamations and correspondence of the mahdi.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAHOMMEDAN INSTITUTIONS.<a name="ar36" id="ar36"></a></span> Of all the institutions
of Islam the caliphate is the oldest, the most fundamental, and
in essence the most enduring. For its history see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Caliphate</a></span>;
the present subject is its origin and nature. Mahomet enjoyed
absolute rule over his people as a divinely inspired and guided
prophet. He led the public prayers; he acted as judge; he
ruled. If he consulted with others or paid attention to public
feeling or local usage, it was as a matter of policy; the ultimate
decision lay with himself. He was the state. On his death a
leader was put in his place of similar authority, though without
the divine prophetic guidance. He was called the &ldquo;successor&rdquo;
(<i>khal&#299;fa</i>, caliph) of the Prophet, later also the <i>am&#299;r-al-mu&rsquo;min&#299;n</i>,
<span class="sidenote">The Caliphate.</span>
commander of the faithful, and was elected by the
Moslems, just as the Arab tribes had always elected
their chiefs. He was thus an absolute ruler, but was democratically
elected; and such is the essence of the caliphate among
Sunnite Moslems to this day. For them it has been a matter
of agreement (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mahommedan Law</a></span>) from the earliest times
that the Moslem community must appoint such a leader (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Im&#257;m</a></span>). The Shi&lsquo;ites, on the other hand, hold that the appointment
lies with God, and that God always has appointed, though
his appointment may not always have been known and accepted.
Their position may be called a legitimist one. Some few heretical
sects have held that the necessity of a leader was based on
reason, not on the agreement of the community. But, for all,
the rule of the leader thus appointed is absolute, and all authority
is delegated from him and, in theory, can be resumed by him at
any time. Just as God can require unreasoning obedience from
his creatures (his &ldquo;slaves&rdquo; in Arabic), so can the caliph, his
representative on earth.</p>

<p>But Abu Bekr, the first caliph, nominated his successor,
Omar, and that nomination was accepted and confirmed by the
people. So a second precedent was fixed, which was again
carried a step farther, when Moawiya I., the first Omayyad
caliph, nominated his son, Yaz&#299;d I., as his successor, and caused
an oath of allegiance to be taken to him. The hereditary
principle was thus introduced, though some relics of the form of
election persisted and still persist. The true election possible
in the early days of the small community at Medina became first
a formal acceptance by the populace of the capital; then an
assertion, by the palace guard, of their power; and now, in the
investiture of the sultans of the Ottoman Turks, who claim the
caliphate, a formal ceremony by the &lsquo;ulem&#257; (<i>q.v.</i>) of Constantinople.
The Ottoman claim is based on an asserted nomination
by the last Abbasid, who died in exile in Egypt in 1538, of the
Ottoman sultan, Suleiman the Great, as his successor. Such a
nomination in itself was a perfectly legal act, but in this case had
a fatal flaw. It is an absolute condition, laid down in tradition,
that the caliph must be of the tribe of Koreish (Quraish),
that of the Prophet.</p>

<p>The duties of this democratically elected autocrat are, in
theory, generally stated as follows. He shall enforce legal
decisions and maintain the divinely revealed restrictive ordinances;
guard the frontiers and equip armies; receive the alms;
put down robberies, thieving, highwaymen; maintain the
Friday services and the festivals; decide disputes and receive
evidence bearing on legal claims; marry minors, male and female,
who have no guardians; divide booty. He must be a free,
male, adult Moslem; must have administrative ability; must be
an effective governor and do justice to the wronged. So long as
he fulfils these conditions he is to be absolutely obeyed; private
immorality or even tyranny are not grounds for deposing him.
This is a position reached by Islam practically. But a caliph
who openly denied the faith would be as impossible as an unbelieving
pope. The caliph, therefore, is the highest executive
officer of a system assumed to be definite and fixed. He, in a
word, administers Islam; and the content of Islam is determined
by the agreement of the Moslem people, expressed immediately
through the &lsquo;ulem&#257;, and ultimately, if indirectly and half-consciously,
by the people. To depose him a <i>fatw&#257;</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mufti</a></span>)
would be required&mdash;in Turkey from the Sheikh-ul-Isl&#257;m&mdash;that
he had violated some essential of the Moslem faith, and no longer
fulfilled the conditions of a caliph.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>But it was impossible for the caliph personally to administer
the affairs of the empire, and by degrees the supreme office was
gradually put into commission, until the caliph himself
became a mere figure-head, and vanished into the sacred
<span class="sidenote">The D&#299;w&#257;ns.</span>
seclusion of his palace. The history of the creation of
government bureaus (<i>d&#299;w&#257;ns</i>; see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Divan</a></span>) must therefore now
be sketched. The first need which appeared was that of a
means of regulating and administering the system of taxation
and the revenues of the state. Immense sums flowed into
Medina from the Arab conquests; the surplus, after the requirements
of the state were met, was distributed among the believers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id="page412"></a>412</span>
All Moslems had a right to a certain share of this, which was
regarded as booty. Omar, the second caliph, regulated this distribution
and also the system of taxation, and the result was the
first divan and the constitution of Omar, looked back to now by all
Sunnite Moslems as an ideal. The sources of revenue were (i) the
poor-rate (<i>zak&#257;t</i>), a tithe paid by every Moslem; (ii) the fifth of all
booty; (iii) the poll-tax (<i>jizya</i>) on non-Moslems; and (iv) the land-tax
(<i>khar&#257;j</i>) also on non-Moslems. Thus the constitution determined
the position of all non-Moslems in a Moslem state. The ideal was
that the Moslems should be kept apart as a superior, fighting caste,
and that the non-Moslems should support them (cf. <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Caliphate</a></span>, B.
§ 8, on the reign of Omar II.). The Moslems, therefore, were forbidden
to acquire land in conquered countries. The non-Moslems
must retain their lands, cultivate them and pay the land-tax (the
Arabic word is also used of revenue from the work of a slave) and
the poll-tax (the Arabic word means also &ldquo;ransom&rdquo;), and give
contributions in kind to support the local Moslem garrisons which
were massed in great camp-cities at strategic points. If a non-Moslem
embraced Islam he entered the ruling caste; his land was
distributed among his non-Moslem fellows, and he no longer paid
the land-tax but rather received support from the public funds.
The amount of these pensions varied with the standing of the
pensioner from 10,000 dirhems (a dirhem equalled about a franc)
to the widows and relations of the Prophet down to 300. This
bureau had, therefore, not only to keep the books of the state, but
also to maintain a list of all Moslems, classified genealogically and
socially. Its registers were kept by Greeks, Copts and Persians;
the Arabs, it may be said in general, adopted the method of administration
which they found in the captured countries and drew
upon the trained services of their inhabitants.</p>

<p>Such a system led naturally to wholesale conversions to Islam;
and the consequent decline in revenue, combined with large donations
of lands by Othman, the third caliph, to his own family,
gradually broke it down. The first patriarchal period of conquest,
unearned wealth and the simple life&mdash;called by Moslems the period
of the &ldquo;four rightly guided caliphs,&rdquo; and very happily by Sachau,
<i>ein mönchisches Imperium</i>&mdash;passed rapidly into the genuinely Arab
empire of the Omayyads, with whom came an immediate development
of organization in the state. The constructive genius in this
was Moawiya, the first Omayyad caliph. Under him the old simplicity
vanished. A splendid and ceremonious court was maintained
at Damascus. A chamberlain kept the door; a bodyguard surrounded
the caliph, and even in the mosque the caliph, warned by
the murder of Othman and of Ali, prayed in a railed-off enclosure.
The beginning of the seclusion of the caliph had come, and he no
longer walked familiarly among his fellow Moslems. This seclusion
increased still further when the administration of the state passed by
delegation into other hands, and the caliph himself became a sacrosanct
figure-head, as in the case of the later Abbasids; when
theories of semi-divine nature and of theocratic rule appeared, as
in the case of the Fatimites; and finally when all the elaborate court
ritual of Byzantium was inherited by the Ottoman sultans.</p>

<p>But Moawiya I. was still a very direct and personal ruler. He
developed a post-system for the carrying of government despatches
by relays, and thus received secret information from and kept
control of the most distant provinces. He established a sealing-bureau
by which state papers were secured against change. He
dealt arbitrarily with the revenues of the state and the pensions of
the Moslems. Governors of provinces were given a much freer
hand, and were required to turn over to the central treasury their
surplus revenue only. As they were either conquerors or direct
successors of conquerors they had an essentially military government,
and were really semi-independent rulers, unhampered except
by direct action of the caliph, acting on information sent by the postmaster,
who was his local spy. Being thus the heads of armies of
occupation, they were not necessarily charged with the control of
religious ritual and of justice. These, like every other function,
inhered in the office of the caliph and he generally appointed in each
province independent cadis over the courts and im&#257;ms to be in
charge of religious services. Yet the governor was sometimes permitted
to hold these two other offices (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cadi</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Im&#257;m</a></span>).</p>
</div>

<p>Further administrative developments came with the Abbasids.
They created a new city, Bagdad, between the Tigris and the
Euphrates, where the three races, Syrian, Arab and Persian, met
and sought with Bagdad as a capital to consolidate the empire.
The Arab empire, it is true, had passed away with the Omayyads;
yet there might be a chance to create a world-empire of all the
Moslem peoples. But not even the genius and administrative
skill of the early Abbasids could hold together that unwieldy
mass. The semi-independent provinces soon became fully
independent, or at most acknowledged the caliph as a spiritual
head and paid a nominal tribute. His name might stand on the
coinage and prayers be offered for him in the Friday service,
the two signs of sovereignty to this day in Islam. With this
crumbling of the empire went a more elaborate organization;
bureaus took the place of principles and of the energy of individual
rulers. As the system of Moslem law was built on that
of the Roman codes, so was the machinery of administration on
that of Persia. And with the Abbasids the chance of the Persians
had come. Ab&#363; &lsquo;l-Abb&#257;s, the first Abbasid caliph, was the first
<span class="sidenote">The Vizierate.</span>
to appoint a vizier (<i>waz&#299;r</i>, &ldquo;helper,&rdquo; so Aaron is
waz&#299;r to Moses in the Koran), a confidential minister
to advise him and come between him and the people. Advisers
the caliphs had had before; but not a definite adviser with this
name. He must, we are told, have a strain of the ruler in him
and a strain of the people to be able to work with both. He
must know how to be acceptable; fidelity and truthfulness are his
capital; sagacity, firmness, generosity, clemency, dignity, effectiveness
of speech are essential. It is plain that the vizier became
as important as the caliph. But Ab&#363; &rsquo;l-Abb&#257;s was fortunate
in early securing as his vizier the grandfather of the house of
the Barmecides (<i>q.v.</i>). On this Persian family the fortunes of
the Abbasids hung, and it secured for them and for Islam a short
golden age, like that of the Antonines, until the jealous madness
of H&#257;r&#363;n al-Rash&#299;d cast them down. Thereafter the vizierate
had many vicissitudes. Technically a vizier could be either
limited or unlimited. The limited vizier had no initiative; he
carried out the commands of the caliph. The unlimited vizier,
often afterwards called the grand vizier, exercised full authority
and was the <i>alter ego</i> of the caliph, to whom he was required
only to report. Naturally the formal distinction is a later
theorizing of history; for a weak ruler his vizier became absolute,
for a strong ruler his vizier remained subordinate. Here, as
with regard to all Moslem institutions, a marked distinction
must be made between the historic facts and the speculative
edifices raised by constitutional theorizers. Compare especially
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mahommedan Law</a></span>. Until the time of R&#257;&#7693;&#299; (934-940) the
vizierate thus fluctuated in importance. In that caliphate the
vizier lost all authority, and in his place came the <i>am&#299;r al-omar&#257;</i>&mdash;equivalent
to the <i>major domus</i> of the Franks&mdash;the head of the
Turkish bodyguard, in terror of whom the caliph now stood.
When in 945 the B&#363;yids captured Bagdad and the caliph became
a purely spiritual sovereign, they took the title &ldquo;vizier&rdquo; for
their own chief minister, and the caliphs retained only a secretary
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Caliphate</a></span>, C. § 22). Under the Seljuks, however,
they regained their viziers and some real authority. Elsewhere,
also the vizierate had its vicissitudes. Under the Mamelukes
the vizier fell to be merely the court purveyor. Under the
Omayyads of Spain the title was given to several responsible
officers of the state, but their chief was called <i>&#7717;&#257;jib</i>, chamberlain.
Under the Almohades the chamberlain was called vizier. In the
modern Turkish empire the grand vizier (called generally <i>&#7779;adr
A&lsquo;&#7827;am</i>) is the sultan&rsquo;s representative in secular matters, and
nominally stands between the sovereign and all the other officials.
He is the president of the council of ministers, but Abd-ul
Hamid II. deprived the office of almost all its importance.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Under the early Abbasids the four most important ministers were
the chief cadi, the chief of police or head of the life guards, the
minister of finance and the postmaster, who was the
head of the system of information and espionage which
<span class="sidenote">Other Ministers.</span>
covered the empire. But at different times the different
bureaus varied greatly. Under Motawakkil we find the bureau
of taxes and finance; bureau of the crown estates; bureau of state
book-keeping; bureau of war, <i>i.e.</i> of hired troops; bureau which
kept reckoning and control of the pensions of the clients and
slaves of the ruling family; bureau of the post system; bureau of
expenditures. But in spite of this elaborate system, no Moslem
government has, except sporadically, been highly centralized. Provided
the taxes are paid, a large measure of local autonomy has
always been enjoyed by the country districts. Under the Abbasids
almost the only exception was the necessarily centralized control
of the irrigation system of the Tigris and Euphrates. And
similarly elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the case of all these offices, we have delegation by the caliph,
under necessity, of his too heavy burdens. But one duty of an
Oriental ruler he could not so easily lay aside. It had always to be
possible for the oppressed to come into his presence and claim justice;
he must sit in the gate and judge. Therefore, when the caliph found
it necessary to delegate the ordinary administration of justice, he
found it also necessary to set up a special court of oppressions, which
developed, to a certain extent, into a court of appeals. The first
to establish such a separate court was Abdalmalik the Omayyad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page413" id="page413"></a>413</span>
(685-705), and his example was followed by the more vigorous of the
caliphs up to the time of Mohtad&#299; the Abbasid (869-870). If any
other than the caliph presided over this court it had to be a man
whose dignity, independence and authority commanded respect. He
was not bound by strict rules of evidence, method and literal application
of law as was the cadi. Rather, he applied a system of equity
suited to the absolute source of authority which he represented.</p>

<p>As the chief of police, mentioned above, was rather the head of the
caliph&rsquo;s bodyguard, there was also a police system after our ideas,
but more thoroughgoing. The <i>muhtasib</i> had charge in the broadest
sense of public order and morals in the streets, and had oversight as
to weights, measures and adulterations; but had no right to interfere
privately or enter houses save in the clearest and most necessary cases.
He had a summary jurisdiction in all minor cases where no trial was
necessary; but where witnesses and oaths entered the case must go
to the cadi. Slaves and beasts of burden were under his guardianship;
he prevented public scandals, such as the sale of wine; he regulated
the public conduct of Jews and Christians. In the interest
of public morals he had to find suitable husbands for widows and
see that they did not marry before the legal time; questions of
paternity also he had to investigate. The outdoor costume of the
people he could regulate. It should, of course, be remembered that
the canon law of Islam covers minutely all sides of life (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mahommedan
Law</a></span>).</p>
</div>

<p>It is impossible in Islam to separate logically from the mass
of institutions those which we should call religious, as Islam on
all sides is for the Moslem equally religious. But perhaps the
following may practically be separated under that rubric. Islam,
runs a tradition, is built on five things: testimony that there is
no god save Allah, and that Mahomet is the apostle of Allah;
prayer; the poor-rate; pilgrimage; fasting. For these see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mahommedan Religion</a></span>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The law and usage of religious foundations in perpetuity (<i>waqf</i>,
mortmain) became as important in Islam as monastic endowments
in medieval Europe, and such foundations tended similarly to absorb
the greater part of the national wealth. It was the only safe way
of providing for posterity. A pious foundation could be erected in
such a way that either so much from its funds would be paid yearly
in perpetuity to the descendants of the erector, or those descendants
would be employed as officials of the foundation.</p>

<p>When it became impossible for the caliph to lead the people
personally in prayer in the mosque, he delegated that part of his
duties to another, hence called im&#257;m (<i>q.v.</i>). Naturally,
then, the appointment of the im&#257;m would lie with the
<span class="sidenote">The Im&#257;m.</span>
supreme ruler. This holds of the daily prayers in the principal
mosque (<i>al-masjid al-j&#257;mi&lsquo;</i>) supported by the ruler where the Friday
service is held, but in the separate smaller mosques built by each
community the community chooses its own im&#257;m. With regard
to the Friday service, the schools of law disagree as to the necessity
of the presence of an im&#257;m appointed by the chief ruler. But the
im&#257;m should certainly make mention of the ruler in his sermon and
pray for him. At the occasional prayers, such as those for rain, &amp;c.,
the presence of an im&#257;m appointed by the ruler is not necessary. The
im&#257;m appoints the <i>muaddhin</i>, the announcer of the hour of prayer
from the minaret, and both have a claim on the state treasury.</p>

<p>Another office exercised when possible by the caliph, but very
frequently delegated to some high dignitary, such as the heir to the
caliphate or a prince, was the leadership of the pilgrimage caravan
to Mecca and back. Sometimes this official, called <i>am&#299;r-al-&#7717;ajj</i>, was
appointed im&#257;m as well. He then led all the pilgrimage ceremonies
at Mecca. When outside of towns where there was a cadi he
exercised also over the caravan the rights of a judge.</p>

<p>Mahommedan law (<i>q.v.</i>) is treated separately. Here, again, as
judging is a duty of the caliph, a cadi is the delegate, or, when appointed
by a vizier or governor, a delegate of his delegate.
He examines into disputes brought before him and
<span class="sidenote">The Cadi.</span>
enforces his judgments, he names administrators of the estates of
minors, the insane, &amp;c.; he supervises the <i>waqf</i> property of mosques
and schools in his district and inspects highways and public buildings;
he watches over the execution of wills; he inflicts the due legal
penalties for apostasy, neglect of religious duties, refusal to pay taxes,
theft, adultery, outrages, murder; he can inflict the penalties of
imprisonment, fine, corporal punishment, death; if there is no im&#257;m,
he can perform his duty, as in fact can anyone who has the requisite
knowledge. But it should be noticed that all this holds only of the
un-europeanized Moslem state.</p>
</div>

<p>For the existence of an army in Islam, there are two grounds,
the holy war (<i>jih&#257;d</i>, <i>q.v.</i>) against unbelievers without the state
and the suppression of rebellion within. Under the
ordinance of Omar the entire community was preserved
<span class="sidenote">The Army.</span>
and used as a weapon for the subduing of the world to
Islam, and every able-bodied male Moslem was theoretically a
fighting man, part of the national militia. This army was
divided into corps situated in the conquered lands, as armies
of occupation, where they eventually came to form military
colonies in great camp-cities. The occupied countries had to
support them, and they were bound to render military service
at any time. But as the ideal of Omar broke down before facts
the use of mercenary and slave troops finally increased; although
there has always continued in Moslem armies acting against
unbelievers a proportion of volunteers not paid a fixed wage
but subsidized by the state from the poor-rate and alms funds.
The generals were appointed by the caliph, and had either
unlimited authority to act as his representatives, concluding
peace, acting as cadi and im&#257;m, distributing booty; or were
restricted within limits, <i>e.g.</i> to simple leading of the troops and
carrying on military operations. They, in turn, appointed their
subordinates; this principle of giving a head full powers and
full responsibility was very generally applied in Islam. It was
controlled of course by the espionage of the postal system. As
war by a Moslem power is essentially sacred war, the regulations
of <i>jihad</i> must be considered here. Unbelievers must first be
invited to embrace Islam and, if they follow a sacred book and
are not idol-worshippers, are given a choice between (<i>a</i>) becoming
Moslems; or (<i>b</i>) submitting to the Moslems and entering on a
treaty with them of protection and tribute; or (<i>c</i>) fighting. If
they accept Islam, their lives, families and property are secure,
and they form henceforth part of the Moslem community. The
ability of Islam to create a common feeling between highly
different races is one of its most striking features. If they
submit and enter on treaty relations, they pay a poll-tax, for
which their personal safety is assured, and assume a definitely
inferior status, having no technical citizenship in the state, only
the condition of protected clients (<i>dhimm&#299;s</i>). If they elect to
fight, the door of repentance is open, even when the armies are
face to face. But after defeat their lives are forfeit, their families
are liable to slavery, and all their goods to seizure. It is open
to the sovereign either to put them to death; or to enslave
them; or to give them their liberty; or to exchange them for
ransom or against Moslem prisoners. The sovereign will choose
that which is best for Islam. As for their families and wealth, the
sovereign can release them only with consent of the army that
has captured them. Apostates must be put to death. Four-fifths
of the booty after a battle goes to the conquering army.</p>

<p>The technical art of war seems to have been little studied
among Moslems; they have treatises on archery but very little
upon tactics. Their writers recognize, however, the essential
difference between the European and Persian methods of charging
in solid lines and holding the ground stubbornly, and the Arab
and Berber method of flying attacks and retreats by clouds of
cavalry. Therefore, one explained, the custom grew of using
a mass of European mercenaries as a fixed nucleus and rallying-point.
The early Moslem armies, too, had used the solid,
unyielding charge, which may have been the secret of their
success. For one of the greatest puzzles of history is the cause
which changed the erratic, untrustworthy swarms of Arab
horsemen with their childish strategy into the ever-victorious
legions of the first caliphs. They certainly learned rapidly.
Byzantium and Persia taught them the use of military engines
and the entrenched camp. Before that they had been, at the
best, single knights with mail-shirt, helmet, sword and lance.
Bowmen, too, they used, but the principal use of the bow seems
to have come with the Turks.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The glory of Moslem education was its university system, which
fed the higher learning and did not serve everyday needs. Its
primary system was very poor, almost non-existent;
and technical education has never been recognized in
<span class="sidenote">Education.</span>
Islam. Primary teachers were despised as ignorant and foolish.
Apparently, if we may trust the many stories of how ignorant
men set up for themselves, there was no control of them by the
state. Their pupils were young only; they taught the rudiments
of reading, Koran, catechism, prayer, writing and arithmetic, but
very little of the latter. Technical education was given by the
gilds through their apprentice system, teaching mechanical arts
and crafts. This was genuine instruction, but was not so regarded;
it was looked upon rather as are the mysteries and secrets of operative
masonry. It produced artisans of independent character, but not
artists. Thus there was no distinction between architect and builder;
there was no sculpture; and painting, so far as it went, was like
carving, a craft. All Moslem university education, like all Moslem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page414" id="page414"></a>414</span>
science, revolved round theology. There were, apparently, only two
outstanding exceptions to this rule, the academy of Mamun (813-833)
at Bagdad, and the hall of wisdom of the Fatimites at Cairo
(1004-1171); both of these are explained by their environment.
From the earliest times, independent scholars instructed classes
in mosques&mdash;the common places of meeting for the community&mdash;and
gave their pupils personal certificates. Their subjects were
the reading and interpretation of the Koran; the body of traditions
from the Prophet; the thence deduced system of theology;
the canon law. But the interpretation of the Koran involved
grammatical and lexicographical studies of early Arabic, and hence
of the early Arabic literature. Theology came to involve metaphysical
and logical studies. Canon law required arithmetic and
mensuration, practical astronomy, &amp;c. But these last were strictly
ancillary; the object of the instruction was primarily to give knowledge
of value for the life of the next world, and, secondarily, to turn
out theologians and lawyers. Medicine was in Jewish and Christian
hands; engineering, architecture, &amp;c., with their mathematical bases,
were crafts. Then this instruction was gradually subsidized and
organized by the state, or endowed by individuals. How early this
took place is uncertain. But the individual teacher, with his
certificate, remained the object of the student; there was nothing
corresponding to our general degrees. Thirdly, educational institutions
came to be equipped with scholarships of money or in kind
for the students. The first instance of this is generally ascribed to
Nishapur (Nais&#257;b&#363;r) in 1066; but it soon became general in the
system and afforded a means of control and centralization. A final,
and most important, characteristic was the wide journeying of the
students &ldquo;in search of knowledge.&rdquo; Aided by Arabic as the universal
language of learning, students journeyed from teacher to teacher,
and from Samarkand to the Atlantic, gathering on their way hundreds
of personal certificates. Scholars were thus kept in touch all over
the Moslem world, and intellectual unity was maintained.</p>
</div>

<p>To the democratic equality of Islam, in which the slave of
to-day may be the prime minister of to-morrow, there is one
outstanding exception. The descendants of the
Prophet and of his relatives (the family of H&#257;shim)
<span class="sidenote">The Sayyids.</span>
formed and form a special class, held in social
reverence, and guarded from contamination and injury. These
are the <i>sayyids</i> (lords), and genealogical registers of them are
carefully preserved. They are of all degrees of wealth and
poverty, but are guarded legally from <i>mésalliances</i> with persons
of ignoble origin or equivocal occupation. Their influence is
very great, and in some parts of the Moslem world they have
the standing and reverence of saints.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAHOMMEDAN LAW.<a name="ar37" id="ar37"></a></span> The legal situation in the Moslem
world is of the highest complexity, and can be made intelligible
only by tracing its historical development. First came the
system (<i>fiqh</i>, <i>shar&#299;&lsquo;a</i>) which takes the place in Islam of canon
law in Roman Christendom. It begins with Mahomet sitting
as judge over the primitive Moslem community at Medina. He
was the Prophet of God, and judged, as he ruled, absolutely;
any decision of his was valid. But he found it, in general,
advisable and fitting to follow the local law or usage of Medina
when the new faith did not require a change. It thus came
about that his decisions followed, at one time, the usage of the
Arab tribes of Medina; at another, the law respected by the
Jewish tribes there&mdash;a rabbinic development of the law of Moses,
deeply affected by Roman law; at another, the more developed
commercial law of Mecca, known to his followers who had fled
thence with him; or, finally, his own personal judgment, stated
it might be as his own sense of right or as the decision of Allah
and even incorporated in the Koran. In his use of these he was
an eclectic opportunist, and evidently, except as regards such
frequently recurring subjects as inheritance, marriage, &amp;c., had
no thought of building up a system or code. At his death he
left behind only a few specific prescriptions in the Koran and
a mass of recorded decisions of cases that had come before him.
He had used himself, in our terms, common law, equity, legislation;
to guide his followers he left his legislative enactments and
the record of his use of common law. Since his death there has
been no new legislation in orthodox Islam.</p>

<p>With the death of Mahomet began the development and
codification of Moslem law. It was at first entirely practical.
Cases had to be decided, and to decide them there was, first,
the Koran; secondly, if nothing <i>ad rem</i> was found in the Koran,
there were the decisions of the Prophet; thirdly, if these failed,
there was the common law of Medina; and, fourthly, if it, in
turn, failed, the common sense of the judge, or equity. A
knowledge of the decisions of Mahomet came thus to be of great
importance, and records of such decisions were eagerly sought and
preserved. But this was simply a part of a much wider movement
and tendency. As among primitive peoples in general, custom
and usage have always been potent among the Arabs. The
ways of the fathers, the old paths, they love to tread. Very
early there arose a special reverence for the path and usage
(<i>sunna</i>) of Mahomet. Whatever he did or said, or left unsaid
or undone, and how he did it, has become of the first importance
to the pious Moslem, who would act in every way as did the
Prophet. There is evidence that for this purpose the immediate
companions of Mahomet took notes, either in memory or in
writing, of his table talk and wise sayings, just as they took
down or learned by heart for their private use the separate
fragments of the Koran. His sayings and doings, manners and
customs, his answers to questions on religious life and faith,
above all his decisions in legal disputes, came to be recorded on
odd sheets in private notebooks. This was the beginning of
the enormous literature of traditions (<i>&#7717;ad&#299;th</i>) in Islam. The
collecting and preserving of these, which was at first private,
for personal guidance and edification, finally became one of the
most powerful weapons of political and theological propaganda,
and coloured the whole method and fabric of Moslem thought.
All knowledge tended to be expressed in that form, and each
element of it to be traced back to, and given in the words of,
some master or other through a chain of transmitters. Above
all there grew up an enormous mass of evidently forged sayings
put into the mouth of Mahomet. At every important political
or theological crisis each party would invent and put into circulation
a tradition from him, supporting its view. By a study
of these flatly opposed &ldquo;sayings&rdquo; it is possible to reconstruct
the different controversies of Islam in the past, and to discover
what each party regarded as the essence of its position.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The first collecting of traditions was for private purposes, and the
first publication dealing with them was legal. This was the Muwa&#7789;&#7789;a&rsquo;
of Malik ibn Anas (d. 795), a <i>corpus juris</i> based partly on traditions,
and a protest in its methods against the too speculative character of
the books of canon law which preceded it. Thereafter came collections
of two different types. The earlier kind was arranged according
to the companions of Mahomet, on whose authority the traditions
were transmitted; after each companion came the traditions going
back to him. The best known example of this kind is the <i>Musnad</i>
of A&#7717;mad ibn &#7716;anbal. The other kind, called <i>Mu&#351;annaf</i> (classified),
contains traditions arranged in chapters according to their subject
matter. That of Bukh&#257;r&#299; is the most famous, and is arranged to
give a traditional basis for a complete system of canon law; its
rubrics are those of such a system. Another is that of Muslim ibn
al-&#7716;ajj&#257;j, who paid less attention to legal aspects and more to minute
accuracy. There are many others of more or less acceptance and
canonicity. Bukh&#257;r&#299;&rsquo;s book enjoys a reverence only second to that
of the Koran. But in all these publications the primary object was
to purify the mass of traditions of forged accretions and to give to
the believer a sound basis for his knowledge of the usages of the
Prophet, whether for his personal or for public use. These two kinds
were a natural development. In the Moslem community there were
from the first students of tradition proper whose interest lay in collecting,
testing and transmitting, not in combining, systematizing
and elucidating; whose preference was to take a single statement
from the Prophet and apply it to a case, without reasonings or
questionings. And there were students of canon law who were
interested rather in the system and results, and who, while they used
traditions, used them only to an end and insisted on the free application
of speculative principles. The conflict of the future was to be
between these traditionalists, on the one hand, and rationalists, on
the other; and the result was to be a compromise.</p>
</div>

<p>With the wide sweep of Moslem conquest another element
came into the development. This was Roman law, which the
Moslem jurist found at work in the conquered Roman provinces
and in the law courts of which they went to school. It is to
be remembered that the Arab armies were not devastating
hordes; they recognized the need of law and order wherever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page415" id="page415"></a>415</span>
they went, and it was the policy of their leaders to take over
the administrative systems of the countries which they seized.
Even the Arabic legal nomenclature shows evident signs of
literal translation from Latin, and many Moslem principles can
be traced to the Roman codes. One important development
was plainly influenced by the liberty involved in the <i>Responsa
prudentium</i> of Roman lawyers, and by the broad conception
of the law of nature in the Edict of the Praetor. In its earliest
stages Moslem law recognized in the judge a liberty of opinion
(<i>ra&rsquo;y</i>) which went beyond even that of the <i>Responsa</i> and became
plain equity, in the English sense, and one school (the Hanifite)
established as a basis the right of preference (<i>isti&#7717;s&#257;n</i>) even when
the analogy of the code dictated otherwise; while another (the
Malikite) used the term <i>isti&#7779;l&#257;&#7717;</i>, &ldquo;a seeking of (general) benefit&rdquo;
to the community, in a similar situation. But these developments
were bitterly contested, and the liberty of opinion was
in the end narrowed down to a principle of analogy (<i>qiy&#257;s</i>), the
nearest approach to which in Western law is legal fiction.</p>

<p>It is necessary now to return to the first successors of Mahomet.
&ldquo;For thirty years after my death,&rdquo; he is said to have declared,
&ldquo;my people will tread in my path (<i>sunna</i>); thereafter will come
kings and princes.&rdquo; This tradition crystallizes the later feeling
of Islam. The first thirty years were a golden age; the centre of
the state was the Prophet&rsquo;s own city of Medina; the conditions
of the state continued in close conformity to those of his own
time. The study of tradition, <i>i.e.</i> of his usage, went hand in
hand with the study of law. They were vital functions of the
state, and it encouraged both.</p>

<p>Then came the great <i>débâcle</i>. The <i>ancien régime</i>, a semi-monkish,
theocratic empire, went down, and the Omayyad
dynasty, kings and princes of the old Arab type, took its place
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Caliphate</a></span>, B). The public life of the state was no longer
deeply religious; the pious said that it was godless. Under
these conditions law was indeed still needed; but it had to be
opportunist. Its development went on, but became speculative.
The study of tradition was now private, and its students were
more and more the personally pious. There were, thus, two
results. On the one hand, the framers of systems of canon
law&mdash;as it now was&mdash;no longer lived in contact with reality;
hypothetical and ideal structures were reared which could never
stand the touch of the practical law-court. And on another,
traditions and law, even this hypothetical law, came to take
separate roads. The interest of the students of tradition became
the gathering of traditions for their own sake, going no farther
than a striving to regulate each detail of life by some specific,
concrete, prophetic dictum. They had no use for systems that
went beyond the mere registering of these dicta. The feeling
also became widespread that any system of government which
did not simply reproduce the patriarchal form of Medina was
of the world and the devil&mdash;a thing with which no religious man
could have aught to do. At every turn he would have to peril
his soul.</p>

<p>Here we must place the transition of this law with which we
have hitherto dealt from being the law of the land to being in
essence a variety of canon law. It was always broader than any
western secular law. It regulated all the aspects of life&mdash;duty
to God, to one&rsquo;s neighbour, to one&rsquo;s self. It was really a system
of duties, ethical, legal, religious. It did not limit itself to
defining the forbidden (<i>&#7717;ar&#257;m</i>); but designated actions also as
required (<i>far&#7693;</i>, <i>w&#257;jib</i>), recommended (<i>mand&#363;b</i>, <i>musta&#7717;abb</i>),
indifferent (<i>j&#257;&lsquo;iz</i>, <i>mub&#257;&#7717;</i>), disliked (<i>makr&#363;h</i>). It played the
part of, or rendered necessary, a religious director quite as much
as a lawyer. And for a time at Medina it was really the law
of the land. But from the Omayyad period on it has held the
position of the canon law of the Roman Church in countries that
will not recognize it and yet dare not utterly reject it. It
governs, in one or other of its four schools, the private lives of
all pious Moslems; it regulates some semi-public relationships&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>
marriage, divorce, inheritance; it compels respect, if not
acceptance, from the state; and by its ideal standard the world,
filled with righteousness by the Mahdi, will be ruled in the
Moslem millennium.</p>

<p>The rise of the Abbasids brought a change, but not a great
one. They had promised a return to the old religious attitudes,
and the promise was formally kept. But in substance they
were as much as the Omayyads, and though the state was
outwardly on a pious footing, and the religious sentiment of
the people was respected, the old, absolute canon law was not
restored. It was made possible for more theologians and
lawyers to work with the state, but an irreconcilable party still
remained, and the situation was fixed as it is to this day. It is
true that the struggle to adapt such a single and detailed system
to all the varying conditions, climates and times of the great
empire was impossible; but the failure marked the great rent
in the supposed unity of Islam between the church and the
world, religion and law.</p>

<p>Yet the Abbasids did, in their way, encourage legal studies,
and under them processes and results, long pursued in private,
became public. Almost within the first century of their dynasty
the four legal schools, or rites, were formed and the principles
established which survive to this day.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The first school to take definite form was the Hanifite, founded
by Ab&#363; &#7716;an&#299;fa (d. 767), who left behind him a definite system and
many enthusiastic pupils. He was a man of means, in touch with
commercial, but not with practical legal life, a speculative or philosophical
jurist. Being of non-Arab origin, the usage of Medina had
small interest for him. He therefore used few traditions, and preferred
to go back to the Koran, and extract from it by reasoning the
rulings which fitted his ideas. This he called the use of analogy
(<i>qiy&#257;s</i>); but, in his hands, it became practically legal fiction, the
application of a law in some sense undreamed by its first imposer.
But he had another, and still freer instrument. The effect of differences
in local conditions had been early observed and admitted in
general terms. Ab&#363; &#7716;an&#299;fa reduced it to a subjective formula.
Under such conditions he claimed the right of preference (<i>isti&#7717;s&#257;n</i>) of
a ruling suited to the local needs, even when the strict analogy indicated
otherwise. This met and meets with vehement protest
when formally stated, but the usage of Islam has practically accepted
it. His system, finally, was not developed through the exigencies
of actual cases, but was worked out as a system of casuistry, though
in a good sense. He tried, that is, to construct a system of rules to
answer any conceivable question. After his death his pupils
elaborated it still further, and accepted public office. The &lsquo;Abb&#257;sids
adopted his school, and threw their influence on its side; its philosophic
breadth and casuistic possibilities evidently commended it
to them. Later, the Ottoman Turks also adopted it, and it may
be said to hold now a leadership among the four legal rites. Its
influence has undoubtedly tended to broaden and humanize
Moslem law.</p>

<p>Twenty-eight years after Ab&#363; &#7716;an&#299;fa, Malik ibn Anas, the founder
of the Malikite school, died at Medina. In many points his situation
was precisely opposite to that of Ab&#363; &#7716;an&#299;fa, and yet his results
were very similar. He was a working jurist, in practical touch with
actual life; he was in the centre of the tradition of the usage of the
Prophet, in the line, one might say, of the apostolic succession. He,
therefore, used traditions much more generally than did Ab&#363; &#7716;an&#299;fa,
and when he, under pressure, took refuge in opinion, he certainly
felt that he, under his conditions, had a better right to do so than
any outsider. But two of his principles marked a distinct advance
and showed that he was no mere traditionalist. For one, he laid
down the conception of public advantage (<i>isti&#7779;l&#257;&#7717;</i>); when a rule
founded on even a valid analogy would work a general injury it was
to be set aside; justice must not be overcome by logic. And, for
the other, he laid stress on the conception of the agreement (<i>ijm&#257;&lsquo;</i>),
an idea which was to have indefinite importance in the future.
When the surviving companions of the Prophet, after his death,
agreed upon any point as belonging to their store of tradition and
experience, their agreement was accepted as final. In the first
instance they agreed that such had been the statement of the Prophet.
That easily passed over into an agreement that such was the true
Moslem view, and finally into an acceptance of the principle that the
Moslem Church, when unanimous, could formulate truth&mdash;practically
as in the canon of Vincent of Lérins, <i>Quod semper, quod ubique,
quod ab omnibus</i>. But such a broadly catholic position was still in
the future, and for Malik, juristic agreement meant the agreement
of Medina, though there are signs that he permitted the same latitude
to other places also. It was a way of allowing for local conditions
rather than of reaching the voice of the Church. His law book, the
<i>Muwa&#7789;&#7789;a&rsquo;</i>, the earliest in our possession written by the founder of
a school, has already been mentioned. It is a collection of about
seventeen hundred traditions of juristic importance, arranged
according to subject, with appended remarks on the usage of Medina
and on his own view of each matter.</p>

<p>So far opinion and local usage had fully held their own, and the
philosophical jurist had been free to work out his system. The
difference between the <i>isti&#7717;s&#257;n</i> of Ab&#363; &#7716;an&#299;fa and the <i>isti&#7779;l&#257;&#7717;</i> of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page416" id="page416"></a>416</span>
Malik was not great; students attended the lectures of both and
combined their systems. But a reaction now began, and the traditionalist
party finally made itself felt. We have the inevitable
rivalry between the historical-empirical and the speculative-philosophical
schools of jurisprudence, rendered all the more bitter in that
the historical lawyers believed, in this case, that they were defending
a divine institution. There resulted, first, one of the most important
schools, the Sh&#257;fi&lsquo;&#299;te; secondly, an extremely literal school for which
ash-Sh&#257;fi&lsquo;&#299; did not go far enough, and which has now vanished; and
thirdly, the &#7716;anbalite school, still surviving in small numbers, more
moderately traditional than the last.</p>

<p>The school founded by ash-Sh&#257;fi&lsquo;&#299; (d. 820), a pupil of Malik, came
first in order of time. The others were really revolts against the
mildness of his compromise. His characteristics were a broad-minded,
steady grasp of means and ends, a perception of what could
and what could not be done, a willingness to admit all the tried
principles in due balance, and, at one point especially, the insight
of genius as to the possibilities of these principles. He laid great
stress on tradition; a clear, authentic tradition he regarded as no less
valid than the Koran itself. If the tradition was chronologically
later than a Koranic passage and corrected that passage, he followed
the tradition. But in this he was only regulating a fixed tendency.
The Koran may be regarded theoretically as the first of all the
sources of law and theology; practically its clear statements have
been over-ridden in many cases. Most important of all, the principle
of agreement (<i>ijm&#257;&lsquo;</i>) came finally with him to its full rights. The
agreement of the Moslem peoples was to be the voice of God. &ldquo;My
people,&rdquo; said a tradition from Mahomet, &ldquo;will never agree in an
error.&rdquo; And so, over traditions and over the Koran itself, the
agreement tacitly or explicitly ruled and rules. It stamps as
authoritative that which the other principles lay down. At the
head of each section of a Sh&#257;fi&lsquo;&#299;te law book we read, &ldquo;The basis of
this, before the agreement, is such and such.&rdquo; But with the aid of
a principle of this breadth it was easy to reject the opinion which
was so objectionable to the traditionalist party. In its place he took
analogy (<i>qiy&#257;s</i>), which, discreetly used, could serve almost the same
purpose. The Koranic passage or the tradition with which an
analogy was suggested should, he taught, be examined to see if
there was a reason clearly stated for the command. If so, that reason
would give a basis for the analogy. Analogy based on the mechanical
or external could not hold.</p>

<p>The four bases thus laid down by ash-Sh&#257;fi&lsquo;&#299;&mdash;Koran; prophetic
usage as expressed in traditions; analogy; agreement&mdash;have come
to be accepted by all existing schools. This applies to all spheres
of life, ethical, social, theological, legal, and it should never be forgotten
that the Koran is only one of the sources for Moslem faith
and conduct.</p>

<p>Few words are needed for the other, reactionary schools. One,
now long extinct, was founded by a certain D&#257;&lsquo;&#363;d u&#7827;-&#7826;&#257;hir&#299;, &ldquo;David
the Literalist,&rdquo; born three or four years before the death of ash-Sh&#257;fi&lsquo;&#299;,
and so called because he insisted upon an absolutely literal
interpretation of his texts&mdash;Koran or tradition&mdash;without account
of context or metaphor. In consequence he had to reject analogy,
and limited agreement to that of the companions of Mahomet; the
Church of Islam was to have no constructive authority. In one
point he showed great sanity of judgment, namely in his rejection
of the principle <i>jurare in verba magistri</i>, otherwise regnant in Islam.
His school had long and interesting consequences, mostly theological,
but is now extinct, and never took rank with the others. The Moslem
world found his positions too impossible, and now no one swears to
his words. The other, the &#7716;anbalite school, was founded by the
scholars of A&#7717;mad ibn &#7716;anbal after his death in 885. He himself
would never have revolted against his master, ash-Sh&#257;fi&lsquo;&#299;, but it was
soon felt that his system, so far as he had any, was in essential
opposition. He had been no lawyer, but a theologian and a collector
and student of traditions. All his life had been a protest against
speculation in divine things. Where the Koran and traditions were
silent, he, too, had been silent. For this agnostic principle he had
witnessed and suffered, and his standing with the people was that
of a saint. Naturally, then, the last still existent school of traditionalist
protest was launched in his name. It minimizes agreement
and analogy, is literal in its interpretations, and is now by far the
smallest of the four surviving schools. Its external history is that
of a testifying and violent minority.</p>

<p>Other men, such as &#7788;abar&#299;, the historian and commentator, have
had dreams that they, too, might join the Four Im&#257;ms (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Im&#257;m</a></span>)
as founders of legal rites, but none has succeeded. The Four remain
the ultimate exponents of this canon law, and under the banner of
one or other of them every Moslem must range himself. As there
is a principle of unity in Islam, expressed in the alleged prophetic
saying, &ldquo;My people will never agree in an error,&rdquo; so there is a principle
of variety, also expressed in an alleged prophetic saying, &ldquo;The disagreement
of my people is a mercy from God.&rdquo; The four rites may
differ upon many points, yet the adherents of one never dream of
regarding the adherents of the others as outside the Church of Islam;
they are not &ldquo;dissenters&rdquo; in the English sense. God is merciful
to his creatures, and gives them so much liberty of choice. Yet in
practice this liberty is not great. The principle of swearing to the
words of the master is a dead hand laid upon Islam. A man&rsquo;s legal
rite is generally settled by the place and other conditions of his birth,
and after he has once accepted a rite, he must, if good and pious,
follow it in all its details. Only the avowed sceptic or the recognized
eccentric can be an eclectic.</p>

<p>The geographical distribution of the rites is roughly as follows:
Moslems in Central Asia and northern India and the Turks everywhere
are Hanifites; in Lower Egypt, Syria, southern India and the
Malay Archipelago they are Sh&#257;fi&lsquo;&#299;tes; in Upper Egypt and in north
Africa, west of Egypt, they are Malikites; only the Wahh&#257;bis (<i>q.v.</i>)
in central Arabia are &#7716;anbalites. But the will of the sovereign has
also had a powerful influence and has frequently dictated the legal,
as well as the theological, affiliations of his subjects. The Turks, for
example, have thrown their weight almost everywhere on the
Hanifite side. Their policy is to appoint only Hanifite judges
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cadi</a></span>), although for private and personal questions they appoint
and pay Muftis (<i>q.v.</i>) of the other rites. In other cases, with a population
of mixed legal adherence, the government has been known to
appoint judges of different rites.</p>

<p>The Sh&#299;&lsquo;ite canon law is dealt with separately, but some mention
of two outstanding sects is here in place. The Ib&#257;&#7693;ites (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mahommedan
Religion</a></span>: <i>Sects</i>) have a system of canon law which in essentials
is of older codification than that of any of the orthodox schools,
going back to Abdallah ibn I&#7685;&#257;d himself, of the first century of the
Hijra (Hejira). Its basis is above all the Koran, then a sparing use
of traditions, natural to their early origin, and finally the agreement
of their own learned men, again natural to an extreme dissenting
sect, and it still rules the Ib&#257;&#7693;ite communities at Oman, Zanzibar
and the Mzab in southern Algeria. At all these places they, the last
descendants of the Kh&#257;rijites, hold severely apart, while the other
Moslems shrink from them as heretics of the worst. Not nearly
so far from ordinary Islam, but still of an extreme self-conscious
Puritanism are the Wahh&#257;bis. They are really &#7716;anbalites, but
apply the rules of that school with uncompromising, reforming
energy. The doctrine of the agreement of the Church of Islam they
reject; only that of the immediate companions of Mahomet is valid.
The people of Mahomet can err and has erred; each man must, on
his own responsibility, draw his doctrine from the Koran and the
traditions. Here they follow the &#7826;&#257;hirites.</p>
</div>

<p>All these schools of law administer a scheme of duties, which,
as has already been remarked, comes nearest to the canon law
of the Roman Church, and which for centuries has had only a
partial connexion with the real legal systems of the Moslem
peoples. Among the Wahh&#257;bis and Ib&#257;&#7693;ites alone is it the
whole of law. Elsewhere, since the Omayyad period, its courts
have been in great part pushed aside by others, and its scheme
has come to be regarded as an expression of impossible theory,
to be realized at best with the coming of the millennium. The
causes and methods of this change call now for detailed notice.</p>

<p>As Islam spread beyond the desert and the conditions in which
the life of Mahomet and his companions had been cast, it came
to regions, climates, customs, where the Arabian usages no
longer held. Not only were the prescripts of Medina ill adapted
to the new conditions; the new people had legal usages of their
own to which they clung and which nothing could make them
abandon. It was rather the Moslem leaders who were compelled to
abandon their ideas and for the sake of the spread of Islam
to accept and incorporate much that was diametrically opposed
to the original legislation either of the Koran or of Mahomet&rsquo;s
recorded <span class="correction" title="amended from decisons">decisions</span>. As in religion the faiths of the conquered
peoples were thinly veneered with Moslem phrases, so in law
there grew up a customary code (<i>&lsquo;&#257;d&#257;t</i>) for each country, differing
from every other, which often completely obscured and annulled
the prescriptions of the canon law. The one was an ideal
system, studied and praised by the pious learned; the other
was the actual working of law in the courts.</p>

<p>But besides the obstinate adherence of various peoples to
their old paths, the will of individual rulers was a determining
factor. When these ceased to be saints and students of divine
things, and came to be worldly statesmen and opportunists,
followers of their own objects and pleasures, no system could
hold which set a limit to their authority. The Oriental ruler
must rule and judge on his own initiative, and the schools of
canon law tended to reduce everything to an academic fixedness.
There thus arose a new and specific statute law, emanating from
the sovereign. At first he judged in the gate as seemed good
in his eyes and as was his right and duty (cf. &ldquo;court of oppressions&rdquo;;
see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mahommedan Institutions</a></span>); later, his will was
codified as in the Turkish statute law (<i>qaw&#257;n&#299;n</i>) derived from
various European codes. Thus there has grown up in almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page417" id="page417"></a>417</span>
every Moslem country at least two systems of courts, the one
administering this canon law, and taking cognisance of private
and family affairs, such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, its
officials also giving rulings on purely personal religious questions,
such as details of the ritual law, the law of oaths and vows, &amp;c.;
the other, the true law courts of the land, administering codes
based on local custom and the decrees of the local rulers.</p>

<p>A rift almost as important entered the legal life of the Moslem
lands on another side. Non-Moslem communities, settled in
Moslem territory, have been uniformly permitted to administer
and judge themselves according to their own customs and laws.
Save when they come into direct contact and conflict with
Moslems, they are left to themselves with a contemptuous
tolerance. The origin of this attitude in Islam appears to be
threefold: (i) The Islam of theory cannot conceive of a mixed
state; it takes account, only, of a state containing none but
Moslems, and its ideal is that the whole world will, in the end,
form such a state. In practice, then, Moslems try to shut their
eyes to the existence of non-Moslems in their midst and make no
provision for them until compelled. That a non-Moslem should
have the same civil position as a Moslem is unthinkable.
(ii) This, of course, produces an attitude of extreme contempt.
The only citizens are Moslems and all others are to be looked down
upon and left to themselves. What they do or think among
themselves does not matter; they are outside the ring-fence of
Islam. (iii) A different, but equally important, cause is the
Moslem indolence. When the Arabs conquered, they knew that
they must administer the conquered lands, and they, very
wisely, sought help from the machinery which they found in
operation. But besides the ordinary organization of the state,
they found also various ecclesiastical organizations, Christian
and Jewish, and to these they gave over the administration of
the non-Moslem sections of the community, making their rabbis
and bishops their responsible heads and the links of contact
with the Moslem rulers. They, unquestionably, found the same
method in use by the Byzantine government; but in Moslem
hands it went so far as to make a number of little states (<i>millet</i>,
<i>milal</i>) within the state and effectually to preclude the possibility of
ever welding all the inhabitants of the land into one corporate life.</p>

<p>But this indolence, when applied to resident aliens, had consequences
still more serious, because external as well as internal.
Following the same method of leaving the unbeliever to settle his
affairs for himself, the European merchant, living and trading
in the East, was put first by usage and finally by treaty under
the jurisdiction and control of his own consul. Thus there
grew up the extra-territorial law of the capitulations and conventions,
by which the sanctity of the person and household
of an ambassador is extended to every European. And this
in turn, has reacted on the status of the non-Moslem subject
races, and has come to be the indirect but chief support on
which they lean. Through it, an element has developed which
makes it practically impossible for a Moslem state to introduce
legal changes even remotely affecting its non-Moslem population,
alien or subject, without the consent of the European embassies.
Any change may be upset by their refusal to accept it as incompatible
with the capitulations and conventions. The embassies
have thus, as interpreters of a part, at least, of the constitution,
come to hold a position remarkably, if absurdly, like that of
the Supreme Court of the United States (see Young, <i>Corps de
droit Ottoman, passim</i>).</p>

<p>There may be said, then, in short, to be three elements in
the legal life of a Moslem state: the sacred and fixed canon
law of Islam; the civil law, based on the usages of the different
peoples, Moslem and non-Moslem, and on statutes going back
to the will of rulers; the international law of the capitulations,
with a contractual sanction of its own. The hope for the future
in Islam, there can be little doubt, lies in the principle of the
agreement of the Moslem people, with its conception of catholic
unity, and its ability, through that unity, to make and abrogate
laws. As the Moslem peoples advance, their law can, thus,
advance with them, and the grasp of the dead hand of the canon
law be gradually and legally released.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAHOMMEDAN RELIGION.<a name="ar38" id="ar38"></a></span> The Mahommedan religion is
generally known as <i>Islam</i>&mdash;the name given to it by Mahomet
himself&mdash;and meaning the resigning or submitting oneself to
God. The participle of the same Arabic verb, <i>Muslim</i> (in
English usually spelt Moslem), is used for one who professes this
religion. The expression &ldquo;Mahommedan religion&rdquo; has arisen
in the West probably from analogy with &ldquo;Christian religion,&rdquo;
but is not recognized as a proper one by Moslem writers. Islam
claims to be a divinely revealed religion given to the world by
Mahomet, who was the last of a succession of inspired prophets.
Its <i>doctrine</i> and <i>practices</i> are to be found in (i) the Book of
God&mdash;the Koran&mdash;which was sent down from the highest heaven
to Gabriel in the lowest, who in turn revealed it in sections to
Mahomet; (2) the collections of tradition (<i>&#7717;ad&#299;th</i>) containing the
sayings and manner of life (<i>sunna</i>) of the Prophet; (3) the use
of analogy (<i>qiy&#257;s</i>) as applied to (i) and (2); and (4) the universal
consent (<i>ijm&#257;&rsquo;</i>) of the believers. The <i>worship</i> of Islam consists
in (1) the recital of the creed; (2) the recital of the ordained
prayers; (3) the fast during the month of Ramadh&#257;n; (4) alms-giving;
(5) the <i>hajj</i>, the pilgrimage to Mecca. The <i>theology</i> of
Islam finds its first public expression among the orthodox in
the teaching of al-Ash&lsquo;ar&#299; (d. after 932), but had its real beginning
among the sects that arose soon after the death of Mahomet.</p>

<p>Islam is the latest of the so-called world-religions, and as
several of the others were practised in Arabia at the time of
Mahomet, and the Prophet undoubtedly borrowed some of his
doctrines and some of his practices from these, it is necessary
to enumerate them and to indicate the extent to which they
prevailed in the Arabian world.</p>

<p><i>Relations with Other Religions.</i>&mdash;The religions practised in
Arabia at the time of Mahomet were heathenism, Judaism,
Christianity, and Zoroastrianism.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>i. <i>Heathenism</i> was the religion of the majority of the Arabs. In
the cities of south Arabia it was a survival from the forms represented
in the Sabaean, Minaean and Himyaritic inscriptions of south Arabia
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Arabia</a></span>: <i>Antiquities</i>). The more popular form current among
the nomads is known very imperfectly from the remains of pre-Islamic
poetry and such works as the <i>Kit&#257;b ul-A&#7779;n&#257;m</i> contained
in Yaq&#363;t&rsquo;s geography, from Shahrast&#257;n&#299;&rsquo;s work on the sects, and
from the few references in classical writers. From these we have
mostly names of local deities (cf. J. Wellhausen, <i>Reste arabischen
Heidentums</i>, 2nd ed., Berlin, 1897) and ancient religious customs,
which remained in part after the introduction of Islam (cf. W.
Robertson Smith, <i>The Religion of the Semites</i>, Edinburgh, 1889, and
<i>Kinship and Marriage in Early Arabia</i>, Cambridge, 1885). From
these sources we learn that Arabian religion was a nature-worship
associated with fetishism. Sun, moon and stars were worshipped,
some tribes being devoted to the worship of special constellations.
Certain stones, wells and trees were regarded as sacred and as containing
a deity. Many (perhaps most) tribes had their own idols.
Hobal was the chief god of the Ka&lsquo;ba in Mecca with its sacred stone,
but round him were grouped a number of other tribal idols. It was
against this association (<i>shirk</i>) of gods that Mahomet inveighed in
his attempt to unify the religion and polity of the Arabs. But there
were features in this heathenism favourable to unity, and these
Mahomet either simply took over into Islam or adapted for his
purpose. The popularity of the Ka&lsquo;ba in Mecca as a place of resort
for worshippers from all parts of Arabia led Mahomet not only to
institute the <i>hajj</i> as a duty, but also to take over the customs connected
with the heathen worship of these visits, and later to make
Mecca the <i>qibla</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the place to which his followers turned when
they prayed. The name of Allah, who seems to have been the god
of the Koreish (cf. D. S. Margoliouth, <i>Mohammed</i>, p. 19, London,
1905), was accepted by Mahomet as the name of the one God, though
he abandoned the corresponding female deity Al-l&#257;t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page418" id="page418"></a>418</span></p>

<p>2. <i>Judaism</i> had long been known in Arabia at the time of the
Prophet. Whether Hebrews settled in Arabia as early as the time
of David (cf. R. Dozy, <i>Die Israeliten zu Mecca</i>, Leipzig, 1864), or
not, is of little importance here as Judaism cannot be said to have
existed until the end of the 5th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> The Seleucid persecutions
and the political troubles that ended with the fall of Jerusalem
(<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 70) probably sent many Jews to Arabia. In the 5th and 6th
centuries the history of south Arabia and of Nejr&#257;n is largely that
of the strife between Jews and Christians. In the north-west the
Jews possessed Tem&#257;, Khaibar, Yathrib (Medina), Fadak, and other
smaller settlements. In these they lived as self-contained communities,
not seeking to proselytize but working at their trades,
especially concerned with money and jewelry. Mahomet seems to
have expected their help in his proclamation of monotheism, and his
first <i>qibla</i> was Jerusalem. It was only when they refused to accept
him as prophet that he turned in anger against them. They had,
however, supplied him with much material from the Old Testament,
and the stories of creation, the patriarchs and early kings and prophets
occur continually in the Koran, told evidently as they were
recited by the common people and with many mistakes caused by
his own misunderstanding.</p>

<p>3. <i>Christianity</i>, though later than Judaism, had a sure footing
in Arabia. It had suffered persecution in Nejr&#257;n and had been
supported in the south by the Abyssinian invasions. The kingdom
of Hira was largely Christian; the same is true of the north Arabian
tribes of Bakr and Taghlib, and east of the Jordan and on the Syrian
boundary as well as in Yem&#257;ma Christianity had made progress.
Pre-Islamic literature contains many allusions to the teaching and
practices of Christianity. Of the time of its introduction little is
known; little also of the form in which it was taught, save that it
came from the Eastern Church and probably to a large extent
through Monophysite and Nestorian sects. Tradition says that
Mahomet heard Christian preaching at the fair of Ukaz, and he
probably heard more when he conducted the caravans of Khadija.
Gospel stories derived apparently from uncanonical works, such as
the Gospel of the Nativity, occur in the Koran. The asceticism of
the monks attracted his admiration. A mistaken notion of the
Trinity was sharply attacked by him. It is curious that his followers
in the earliest times were called by the heathen Arabs, Sabians (<i>q.v.</i>),
this being the name of a semi-Christian sect. In the time of the
Omayyads Christianity led to some of the earliest theological sects
of Islam (see below).</p>

<p>4. <i>Zoroastrianism</i> was known to the Arab tribes in the north-east,
but does not seem to have exercised any influence in Mecca or Medina
except indirectly through Judaism in its angelology. As soon,
however, as the armies of Islam conquered Mesopotamia it began
to penetrate the thought and practices of Islam (see below).</p>
</div>

<p><i>Sources of Authority.</i>&mdash;Islam, as we have said, is founded on:
(1) the Koran; (2) the tradition or rather the <i>sunna</i> (manner of
life of Mahomet) contained in the tradition (<i>&#7716;adith</i>); (3) <i>ijm&#257;&lsquo;</i>;
the universal agreement; (4) <i>qiy&#257;s</i> (analogy).</p>

<p>1. The <i>Koran</i><a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> (properly <i>Qur&rsquo;&#257;n</i> from <i>qara&rsquo;a</i> to collect, or
to read, recite) is the copy of an uncreated original preserved by
God (see below), sent down from the seventh heaven to Gabriel
in the first heaven, and revealed to Mahomet in sections as
occasion required. These revelations were recited by the
Prophet and in many cases written down at once, though from
ii. 100 it would seem that this was not always the case. God
is the speaker throughout the revelations. It seems probable
that the whole Koran was written in Mahomet&rsquo;s lifetime, but
not brought together as a whole or arranged in order.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>As it exists now the Koran consists of 114 chapters called <i>suras</i>
(from <i>sura</i>, a row of bricks in a wall, a degree or step). The first
is the <i>F&#257;ti&#7717;a</i> (opening), which occupies the place of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer
in Christianity. The others are arranged generally in order of
length, the longest coming first, the shortest (often the earliest in
date) coming at the end. Certain groups, however, indicated by
initial unvowelled letters, seem to have been kept together from the
time of the Prophet. At the head of each <i>sura</i> is a title, the place
of its origin (Mecca or Medina) and the number of its verses (<i>&#257;y&#257;t</i>)
together with the formula, &ldquo;In the name of God the Merciful,
the Compassionate&rdquo; (except in <i>sura 9</i>). For liturgical purposes the
whole book is divided into 60 sections (<i>a&#7717;z&#257;b</i>) or into 30 divisions
(<i>ajz&#257;</i>), each subdivided into a number of prostrations (<i>ruk&lsquo;a</i> or
<i>sajda</i>). The origin of the collected and written Koran is due to
Omar, who in the caliphate of Ab&#363; Bekr pointed out that many
possessors of <i>suras</i> were being slain in the battles of Islam and their
property lost, that there was a danger in this way that much of the
revelation might disappear, and that men were uncertain what was
to be accepted as genuine revelation. Accordingly Zaid ibn Th&#257;bit
who had been secretary to Mahomet, was commissioned to collect
all he could find of the revelation. His work seems to have been
simply that of a collector. He seems to have done his work thoroughly
and made a copy of the whole for Ab&#363; Bekr. The collection
was thus chiefly a private matter, and this copy passed after Ab&#363;
Bekr&rsquo;s death into the hands of Omar, and after his death to &#7716;af&#7779;a,
daughter of Omar, a widow of Mahomet. In the caliphate of Othman
it was discovered that there were serious differences between the
readings of the Koran possessed by the Syrian troops and those of
the Eastern soldiers, and Othman was urged to have a copy prepared
which should be authoritative for the Moslem world. He appointed
Zaid ibn Th&#257;bit and three members of the tribe of Koreish (Quraish)
to do the work. Each of these made a copy of Ab&#363; Bekr&rsquo;s collection,
carefully preserving Koreishite forms of words. How far the text
was amended by the help of other copies is doubtful; in any case the
mode of procedure was undoubtedly very conservative. The four
similar manuscripts were sent, one each to Medina, Cufa (Kufa),
Basra and Damascus, and an order was issued that all differing
copies should be destroyed. In spite of the personal unpopularity
of Othman this recension was adopted by the Moslem world and
remains the only standard text. A few variant readings and differences
of order of the <i>suras</i> in the collections of Ubay ibn Ka&lsquo;b and
of Ibn Mas&lsquo;&#363;d were, however, known to later commentators. The
only variants after the time of Othman were owing to different
possible ways of pronouncing the consonantal text. These are
usually of little importance for the meaning. As the text is now
always vowelled, variations are found in the vowels of different
copies, and the opinions of seven leading &ldquo;readers&rdquo; are regarded
as worthy of respect by commentators (see Th. Nöldeke, <i>Geschichte
des Qor&#257;ns</i>, pp. 279 seq., Göttingen, 1860). Various characteristics
enable one to establish with more or less certainty the relative
chronological order of the <i>suras</i> in the Koran, at any rate so far as
to place them in the first or second Meccan period or that of Medina.
The form of the sentences is a guide, for the earliest parts are usually
written in the <i>saj&lsquo;</i> form (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Arabia</a></span>: <i>Literature</i>). The expressions
used also help; thus the &ldquo;O ye people&rdquo; of the Meccan period is
replaced in the Medina <i>suras</i> by &ldquo;O ye who believe.&rdquo; The oaths
in the first Meccan period are longer, in the second shorter, and are
absent in the Medinan. In the earliest period the style is more elevated
and passionate. Occasionally the time of origin is determined
by reference to historical events. In accordance with such principles
of criticism two leading scholars, Nöldeke (<i>loc. cit.</i>) and H. Grimme
(in his <i>Mohammed Zweiter Teil</i>. <i>Einleitung in den Koran.</i> <i>System der
koranischen Theologie</i>, Münster, 1895), have arranged the <i>suras</i> as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pt2">On the supposition that the arrangements given above are
at any rate approximately correct, it is possible to trace a certain
development in the teaching of the Koran on some
of the chief dogmas. It must, however, be borne
<span class="sidenote">Theology.</span>
in mind that orthodox Islam recognizes the Koran as the work
not of Mahomet but of God. Yet Moslem theologians recognize
that some revelations are inconsistent with others, and so have
developed the doctrine of <i>n&#257;sikh</i> and <i>mans&#363;kh</i> (&ldquo;abrogating&rdquo;
and &ldquo;abrogated&rdquo;), whereby it is taught that in certain definite
cases a later revelation supersedes an earlier. A critical study
of the Koran shows in the earlier revelations the marks of a
reflective mind trained under the influence of Arabian education
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page419" id="page419"></a>419</span>
and stirred by an acquaintance (somewhat imperfect) with
Judaism and Christianity. The later revelations seem to be
influenced by the now dominant position of the Prophet and a
desire after the capture of Mecca to incorporate such heathen
religious ceremonies as are national. God is one and universal
from the beginning. His unity is emphasized as against the
mistaken conception of the Christian Trinity. At first his
might is taught by the name <i>Rabb</i> (Lord) which is generally
used with an attribute as &ldquo;the highest Lord,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord of the
worlds,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord of men,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord of heaven and earth,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord
of the East and West,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our Lord.&rdquo; Then he is identified
with the god Allah (see above) and the first part of the later
Moslem creed is announced&mdash;<i>la ilaha illa-llaha</i>, &ldquo;there is no
god but Allah.&rdquo; But every act of creation is a proof not only
of God&rsquo;s power but also of his beneficence (xiv. 37), and so he
becomes known as <i>ar-Ra&#7717;m&#257;n</i>, &ldquo;the Compassionate.&rdquo; The
attributes of God may all be arranged in the three classes of
his power, unity and goodness. They are expressed by the
ninety-nine &ldquo;beautiful names&rdquo; applied to him in the Koran
(see E. H. Palmer, <i>The Quran</i> in &ldquo;Sacred Books of the East,&rdquo;
vol. vi., Introd. pp. 67-68, Oxford, 1880). In the Medina period
of Mahomet&rsquo;s life the nature of God is not so clear, and the
description of it varies according to the moods of the Prophet.</p>

<p>Beside God are two other uncreated beings: (1) the original
of the Koran, the &ldquo;mother of the Book&rdquo; (xliii. 3) on a &ldquo;preserved
tablet&rdquo; (<i>lau&#7717; ma&#7717;f&#363;&#7827;</i>) (lxxxv. 22), in accordance with
which God acts, and (2) the throne (<i>kurs&#299;</i>) (ii. 256).
<span class="sidenote">Spirits.</span>
When the heavens are created, God sits on his throne in the
seventh heaven; around him are angels, pure, sexless beings,
some of whom bear the throne, while some are engaged in praising
him continually. They are also his messengers and are sent to
fight with the believers against the heathen. Some are the
guardian angels of men, others are the watchmen of hell. Mediate
beings between God and man are the &ldquo;word&rdquo; (<i>amr</i>) and from
it the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; (<i>r&#363;&#7717;</i>) or &ldquo;holy spirit&rdquo; (<i>r&#363;&#7717; ul-qudus</i>). Another
manifestation of God to the believers only is the &ldquo;glory&rdquo;
(<i>sak&#299;na</i>).</p>

<p>God created the world in six days according to the plan of the
Book. Each new life was created by God&rsquo;s breathing into it a
soul. The duality of soul and body is maintained.
In each man is a good and a bad impulse. The bad
<span class="sidenote">Cosmology.</span>
impulse which was latent in Adam was roused to action by Satan
(<i>Ibl&#299;s</i>). Adam by his fall lost the grace of God, which was restored
to him solely by the gracious choice of God. Between men and
angels in their nature are the genii (<i>jinn</i>) male and female, inhabitants
of desert places, created from smokeless fire. They
had been accustomed to spy round heaven, but in Mahomet&rsquo;s
time could learn no more of its secrets. Some of them were
converted by the Prophet&rsquo;s teaching. Lowest of creation in his
estate is Satan (<i>Shait&#257;n</i>), who was an angel but was expelled from
heaven because he refused to worship Adam at his Lord&rsquo;s command.
God has revealed himself to man by (1) writing (<i>kit&#257;b</i>),
and (2) prophets. As he had given to the Jews the Law (<i>Taur&#257;t</i>)
and to the Christians the Gospel (<i>Inj&#299;l</i>) so he revealed to Mahomet
the Koran (Qur&lsquo;&#257;n, known also by other names, <i>e.g.</i> <i>al-Furq&#257;n</i>, <i>at-Taf&#7779;&#299;l</i>,
&amp;c.), each single revelation being called an aya. With his
revelation God has also sent an apostle or prophet to each people.
Several of these are mentioned in the Koran, Moses the prophet
of the Jews, Jesus (<i>&#298;s&#257;</i>) that of the Christians. Mahomet is not
only the apostle of the Moslems but the &ldquo;seal of the prophets,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i> the final member of the class. His mission at first was to
warn men of imminent judgment. Later he became more of a
teacher. At first he seems to have relied for the salvation of men
on his natural faculties, but later announced the doctrine of God&rsquo;s
election. The ethics of the Koran are based on belief (<i>im&#257;n</i>) and
<span class="sidenote">Ethics.</span>
good works, the latter alone occurring in the early
Meccan <i>suras</i>. Fear of the judgment of God was a
motive of action; this is followed by repentance and turning to
God. A complete surrender to God&rsquo;s will (<i>isl&#257;m</i>) is the necessary
condition of religious life and is expressed in the phrase so common
in everyday speech among the Moslems&mdash;<i>inshallah</i>, &ldquo;if
God will.&rdquo; God has full power to overlook evil deeds if he will.
Unbelievers can acquire no merit, however moral their actions.
A short account of the chief ethical requirements of the Koran is
given in xvii. 23-40:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;Put not God with other gods, or thou wilt sit despised and
forsaken. Thy Lord has decreed that ye shall not serve other than
Him; and kindness to one&rsquo;s parents, whether one or both of them
reach old age with thee, and say not to them, &lsquo;Fie,&rsquo; and do not
grumble at them, but speak to them a generous speech. And lower
to them the wing of humility out of compassion, and say, &lsquo;O Lord!
have compassion on them as they brought me up when I was little!&rsquo;
Your Lord knows best what is in your souls if ye be righteous, and,
verily, He is forgiving unto those who come back penitent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And give thy kinsman his due and the poor and the son of the
road; and waste not wastefully, for the wasteful were ever the
devil&rsquo;s brothers, and the devil is ever ungrateful to his Lord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if thou dost turn away from them to seek after mercy from
thy Lord, which thou hopest for, then speak to them an easy speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make not thy hand fettered to thy neck, nor yet spread it out
quite open, lest thou shouldest have to sit down blamed and
straightened in means. Verily, thy Lord spreads out provision
to whomsoever He will or He doles it out. Verily, He is ever well
aware of and sees His servants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And slay not your children for fear of poverty; we will provide
for them; beware! for to slay them is ever a great sin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And draw not near to fornication; verily, it is ever an abomination,
and evil is the way thereof.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And slay not the soul that God has forbidden you, except for just
cause; for he who is slain unjustly we have given his next of kin
authority; yet let him not exceed in slaying; verily, he is ever helped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And draw not near to the wealth of the orphan, save to improve
it, until he reaches the age of puberty, and fulfil your compacts;
verily, a compact is ever enquired of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And give full measure when ye measure out, and weigh with a
right balance; that is better and a fairer determination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do not pursue that of which thou hast no knowledge; verily,
the hearing, the sight and the heart, all of these shall be enquired of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And walk not on the earth proudly; verily, thou canst not cleave
the earth, and thou shalt not reach the mountains in height.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All this is ever evil in the sight of your Lord and abhorred.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="author1">(E. H. Palmer&rsquo;s translation.)</div>
</div>

<p>The eschatology of the Koran is especially prominent in its
earlier parts. The resurrection, last judgment, paradise and hell
are all described. At death the body again becomes
earth, while the soul sinks into a state of sleep or
<span class="sidenote">Eschatology.</span>
unconsciousness. At a time decreed, known as &ldquo;the hour&rdquo;
(<i>as-Sa&lsquo;a</i>), &ldquo;the day of resurrection&rdquo; (<i>yaum ul-qiyy&#257;ma</i>), &ldquo;day
of judgment&rdquo; (<i>yaum-ud-d&#299;n</i>), &amp;c., an angel will call or will sound
a trumpet, the earth will be broken up, and the soul will rejoin
the body. God will appear on his throne with angels. The great
book will be opened, and a list of his deeds will be given to every
man, to the good in his right hand, to the evil in his left (<i>sura</i> 69).
A balance will be used to weigh the deeds. The <i>jinn</i> will testify
against the idolaters. The righteous will then obtain eternal
peace and joy in the garden (<i>al-janna</i>) and the wicked will be
cast into the fiery ditch (<i>Jahannam</i>), where pains of body and of
soul are united.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Tradition</i>.&mdash;The revelation of God is twofold&mdash;in a
writing and by a prophet. The former was contained in the
Koran, the latter was known from the actions of Mahomet in the
different circumstances of life. The manner of life of the Prophet
(<i>sunna</i>) was contained in the tradition (<i>al-&#7717;adith</i>). The information
required was at first naturally obtained by word of mouth
from the companions and helpers of Mahomet. These in turn
bequeathed their information to their younger companions, who
quoted traditions and gave decisions in their names.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>For long these traditions circulated orally, the authority of each
depending on the person who first gave it and the reliability of the
chain (<i>isn&#257;d</i>) of men who had passed it on from him. At first this
tradition was regarded as explanatory of, or at the most supplementary
to, the teaching of the Koran. Early Moslem teachers
pointed to the Jews as having two law-books&mdash;the <i>Taur&#257;t</i> and the
<i>Mishna</i>&mdash;while Islam had only one&mdash;the Koran. But opinion
changed, the value of tradition as an independent revelation came
to be more highly esteemed until at last it was seriously discussed
whether a tradition might not abrogate a passage of the Koran
with which it was at variance. The writing of traditions was at
first strongly discouraged, and for more than a century the stories
of the Prophet&rsquo;s conduct passed from mouth to mouth. Had all
the narrators been pious men, this might have been tolerable, but
this was not the case. The Omayyad dynasty was not a pious
one. Men who were not religious but wished to appear so invented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id="page420"></a>420</span>
traditions to justify their manner of life. The sectarians did not
hesitate to adopt the same means of spreading their own teaching.
Many Moslem writers testify to the fact that forged traditions were
circulated, and that religious opinion was confused thereby. The
need for some sort of authoritative collection seems to have been
felt by the one pious Omayyad caliph, Omar II. (717-720), who is
said to have ordered Ibn Shih&#257;b uz-Zuhr&#299; to make such a collection.
Of this work, if it was carried out, we know nothing further. It was,
however, by a man born during this reign that the first systematic
collection of traditions was made&mdash;the <i>Muwatta&lsquo;</i> of M&#257;lik ibn Anas
(<i>q.v.</i>). Yet this work is not a book of tradition in the religious sense,
it is really a corpus juris and not a complete one. The object of
M&#257;lik was simply to record every tradition that had been used to
give effect to a legal decision. The work of sifting the vast mass
of traditions and arranging them according to their relation to the
different parts of religious life and practice was first undertaken in
the 3rd century of Islam (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 815-912). In this century all the six
collections afterwards regarded as canonical by the Sunnites (orthodox)
were made. By this time an immense number of traditions
was in circulation. Bukh&#257;r&#299; in the course of sixteen years&rsquo; journeying
through Moslem lands collected 600,000, and of these included
7275 (or, allowing for repetitions, 4000) in his work. The six collections
of tradition received by the Sunnites as authoritative are:
(i) The <i>Kit&#257;b ul-j&#257;m&#299;&lsquo; u&#7779;-&#7778;a&#7717;&#299;&#7717;</i> of Bukh&#257;r&#299; (<i>q.v.</i>) (810-870). This is
the most respected throughout the Moslem world and most carefully
compiled (ed. L. Krehl and T. W. Juynboll, Leiden, 1862&mdash;and
frequently in the East; also with many commentaries. French
translation by O. Houdas and W. Marcais, Paris, 1903 sqq.). (ii) The
<i>&#7778;a&#7717;&#299;&#7717;</i> of Muslim (817-875) with an introduction on the science of
tradition (ed. Calcutta, 1849, &amp;c.). (iii) The <i>Kit&#257;b u&#7779;-Sunan</i> of
Ab&#363; D&#257;&lsquo;&#363;d (817-888) (ed. Cairo, 1863, Lucknow, 1888, Delhi, 1890).
(iv) The <i>J&#257;mi&lsquo; u&#7779;-&#7778;a&#7717;&#299;&#7717;</i> of Tirmidh&#299; (<i>q.v.</i>). (v) <i>The Kit&#257;b u&#7779;-Sunan</i>
of Nas&#257;&lsquo; &#299; (830-915) (ed. Cairo, 1894). (vi) The <i>Kit&#257;b u&#7779;-Sunan</i> of
Ibn M&#257;ja (824-866) (ed. Delhi, 1865 and 1889). The last four are
not held in the same repute as the first two.</p>
</div>

<p>3. <i>Ijm&#257;&lsquo;</i> is the universal consent which is held to justify
practices or beliefs, although they are not warranted by the
Koran or tradition, and may be inconsistent with the apparent
teaching of one or both of these. These beliefs and practices,
which had often come from the pre-Islamic customs of those
who had become believers, seem to have escaped notice until
the Abbasid period. They were too deeply rooted in the lives
of men to be abolished. It became necessary either to find a
tradition to abrogate the earlier forbidding one, or to acknowledge
that <i>ijm&#257;&lsquo;</i> is higher than the tradition. The former expedient
was resorted to by some later theologians (<i>e.g.</i> Naw&#257;w&#299;) by a
fiction that such a tradition existed though it was not found now
in writing. But in earlier times some (as Ibn Qutaiba) had
adopted the latter alternative, saying that the truth can be
derived much earlier from the <i>ijm&#257;&lsquo;</i> than from the tradition,
because it is not open to the same chances of corruption in its
transmission as the latter. Tradition itself was found to confirm
this view, for the Prophet is related to have said, &ldquo;My people
does not agree to an error.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>But <i>ijm&#257;&lsquo;</i> itself has been used in different senses: (i) The <i>ijm&#257;&lsquo;</i>
of Medina was used to indicate the authority coming from the practices
of the people of Medina (see below). (ii) The <i>ijm&#257;&lsquo;</i> of the whole
community of Moslems is that most commonly recognized. It was
used to support fealty to the Abbasid dynasty. By it the six books
of tradition mentioned above are recognized as authoritative, and
it is the justification of the conception of Mahomet as superhuman.
(iii) Some of the more thoughtful theologians recognize only the <i>ijm&#257;&lsquo;</i>
of the doctors or the teachers of Islam (the <i>mujtahid&#363;n</i>), these being
restricted by the orthodox to the first few generations after Mahomet,
while the Shi&lsquo;ites allow the existence of such up to the present
time.</p>
</div>

<p>4. The fourth basis of Islam is <i>qiy&#257;s</i>, <i>i.e.</i> analogy. It is that
process by which a belief or practice is justified on the ground
of something similar but not identical in the Koran, the tradition
or <i>ijm&#257;&lsquo;</i>. Originally it seems to have been instituted as a check
upon the use of private opinion (<i>ra&rsquo;y</i>) in the teaching of doctrine.
The extent to which it may be used is a subject of much
discussion among theologians. Some would apply it only to a
&ldquo;material similarity,&rdquo; others to similarity of motive or cause as
well.</p>

<p><i>Worship and Ritual.</i>&mdash;The acts of worship required by Islam
are five in number: (i) the recital of the creed; (ii.) observance
of the five daily prayers; (iii) the fast in the month of Ramadh&#257;n;
(iv) giving of the legal alms; (v) the pilgrimage to
Mecca.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>i. The creed is belief&mdash;&ldquo;la ilaha illa-llahu, Mu&#7717;ammad ras&#363;l
allahi,&rdquo; &ldquo;there is no god but God (Allah), Mahomet is the apostle
<span class="sidenote">Creed.</span>
of God.&rdquo; It is required that this shall be recited at least
once in a lifetime aloud, correctly, with full understanding
of its meaning and with heartfelt belief in its truth. It is to be
professed without hesitation at any time until death.</p>

<p>ii. Every man who professes Islam is required in ordinary life
to pray five times in each day. In the Koran these prayers are
commanded, though four only are mentioned. &ldquo;Wherefore
glorify God, when the evening overtaketh you, and
<span class="sidenote">Prayer.</span>
when ye rise in the morning, and unto Him be praise in Heaven and
earth; and in the evening and when ye rest at noon&rdquo; (xxx. 16-17),
but commentators say the &ldquo;evening&rdquo; includes the sunset and after
sunset. The five times therefore are: (1) Dawn or just before sunrise,
(2) just after noon, (3) before sunset, (4) just after sunset, and (5) just
after the day has closed. Tradition decides within what limits the
recitals may be delayed without impairing their validity. Prayer is
preceded by the lesser ablution (<i>wa&#7693;&#363;</i>) consisting in the washing of
face, hands (to the elbows) and feet in prescribed manner. Complete
washing of the body (<i>ghusl</i>) is required only after legal pollution.
In prayer the worshipper faces the <i>qibla</i> (direction of prayer),
which was at first Jerusalem, but was changed by the Prophet to
Mecca. In a mosque the <i>qibla</i> is indicated by a niche (<i>mi&#7717;rab</i>) in
one of the walls. The prayers consist of prescribed ejaculations,
petitions, and the recital of parts of the Koran, always including
the first <i>sura</i>, accompanied by prostrations of the body. Detailed
physical positions are prescribed for each part of the worship; these
vary slightly in the four orthodox schools (see below). On a journey,
in time of war or in other special circumstances, the set form of
prayers may be modified in accordance with appointed rules. Besides
these private prayers, there is the prayer of the assembly, which is
observed on a Friday (<i>yaum ul-jam&lsquo;a</i>, &ldquo;the day of assembly&rdquo;) in a
mosque, and is usually accompanied by an address or declamation
(<i>khutba</i>) delivered from a step of the pulpit (<i>minbar</i>). Special
prayers are also prescribed for certain occasions, as on the eclipse of
the sun or the moon, &amp;c. Among the S&#363;fis special attention is
given to informal prayer, consisting chiefly in the continual repetition
of the name of God (<i>dhikr</i>) (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sufi&lsquo;ism</a></span>). This is still a characteristic
of some of the dervish (<i>q.v.</i>) communities.</p>

<p>iii. The command to fast begins with the words, &ldquo;O ye who
believe! There is prescribed for you the fast, as it was prescribed
for those before you.&rdquo; The expression &ldquo;those before
you&rdquo; has been taken to refer to the Jews, who fasted on
<span class="sidenote">Fasting.</span>
the day of atonement, but more probably refers to the long fast of
thirty-six days observed by the Eastern Christians. In the passage
of the Koran referred to (ii. 179-181) Moslems are required to fast
during the month of Ramadh&#257;n, &ldquo;wherein the Koran was revealed,&rdquo;
but if one is on a journey or sick he may fast &ldquo;another number of
days,&rdquo; and if he is able to fast and does not, &ldquo;he may redeem it
by feeding a poor man,&rdquo; but &ldquo;if ye fast, it is better for you.&rdquo; This
fast was probably instituted in the second year at Medina. At that
time the corrected lunar year was in use and Ramadh&#257;n, the ninth
month, was always in the winter. A few years later Mahomet
decreed the use of the uncorrected lunar year, which remains the
standard of time for the Moslem world, so that the month of fasting
now occurs at all seasons of the year in turn. The fast is severe, and
means entire abstinence from food and drink from sunrise to sunset
each day of the month. The fast is associated with the statement
that in this month God sent down the Koran from the seventh heaven
to Gabriel in the lowest that it might be revealed to the Prophet.</p>

<p>iv. Alms are of two kinds: (1) the legal and determined
(<i>zak&#257;t</i>), and (2) voluntary (<i>&#7779;adaq&#257;t</i>). The former were given in
cattle, grain, fruit, merchandise and money once a year
after a year&rsquo;s possession. For cattle a somewhat
<span class="sidenote">Alms.</span>
elaborate scale is adopted. Of grain and fruit a tenth is given if
watered by rain, a twentieth if the result of irrigation. Of the
value of merchandise and of money a fortieth is prescribed. In the
early days of Islam the alms were collected by officials and used for
the building of mosques and similar religious purposes. At the
present time the carrying of these prescriptions is left to the
conscience of the believers, who pay the alms to any needy fellow-Moslem.
A good example of a <i>&#7779;adaq&#257;</i> is found in a gift to an unbeliever
(see C. M. Doughty, <i>Arabia deserta</i>, i. 446, ii. 278, Cambridge,
1888).</p>

<p>v. The fifth religious duty of the Moslem is the pilgrimage (<i>hajj</i>)
to Mecca, which should be performed once by every Moslem &ldquo;if he
is able,&rdquo; that is if he can provide or obtain the means to
support himself on pilgrimage and his family during his
<span class="sidenote">Pilgrimage.</span>
absence, and if he is physically capable. The pilgrimage is made at
one time of the (Moslem) year, namely, from the 7th to the 10th
of the month Dhu&rsquo;l-Hijja. For the arrangements for the journey
from various countries to Mecca see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Caravan</a></span>. When the pilgrim
arrives within five or six miles of the holy city he puts off his ordinary
dress after ablution and prayer, and puts on the two seamless wrappers
which form the dress of the pilgrim (the <i>ihr&#257;m</i>), who goes without
head-covering or boots or shoes. He must not shave at all, or
trim the nails or anoint the head during the ceremonial period.
The chief parts of the ceremonial are the visit to the sacred mosque
(<i>masj&#299;d ul-&#7717;ar&#257;m</i>), the kissing of the black stone, the compassing of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page421" id="page421"></a>421</span>
the Ka&lsquo;ba (the <i>&#7788;aw&#257;f</i>) seven times, three times running, four times
slowly, the visit to the Maq&#257;m Ibrah&#299;m, the ascent of Mount &#7778;af&#257;
and running from it to Mount Marwa seven times, the run to Mount
&lsquo;Araf&#257;t, hearing a sermon, and going to Muzdalifa, where he stays the
night, the throwing of stones at the three pillars in Min&#257; on the great
feast day, and the offering of sacrifice there (for the localities see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mecca</a></span>). After the accomplishment of these ceremonies the ordinary
dress is resumed, the pilgrimage is finished, but the pilgrim usually
remains another three days in Mecca, then visits Medina to pay his
respects to the tomb of Mahomet. Beside the <i>hajj</i> (great pilgrimage)
Islam also recognizes the merit of the <i>&lsquo;umra</i> (or lesser pilgrimage),
<i>i.e.</i> a religious visit to Mecca at any time accompanied by most of
the ceremonies of the <i>hajj</i>.</p>

<p>The ceremonies of the <i>hajj</i> have been described by several European
travellers who have witnessed them, such as J. L. Burckhardt in
1814, Sir Richard Burton in 1853 (see bibliography to <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mecca</a></span>). A
concise account of them is given in T. P. Hughes, <i>Notes on Muhammadanism</i>
(3rd ed., London, 1894). Details in vol. i. of Bukh&#257;r&#299;&rsquo;s
traditions (Houdas and Marcais&rsquo;s French translation, i. 493-567).</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Development of Islam.</i>&mdash;The battle of Siff&#299;n (657) between
&lsquo;Ali and Moawiya was the occasion of the first breach in the
unity of Islam, and the results remain to this day. The occasion
was in the first case political, but politics were at that time too
intimately connected with religion to be considered apart from it.
After the battle (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Caliphate</a></span>) &lsquo;Al&#299; was practically compelled
to submit his claims to arbitration, whereupon a number of his
supporters broke away from him, saying that there should have
been no appeal save to the Book of God. These men were for
the most part country Arabs, and, inspired by the free spirit of
the desert, were democratic, claiming that the caliph should be
elected by the whole community from any family (and not from
the Koreish alone), and that the caliph might be deposed for sin.
A few extremists were republicans and would do without a
caliph altogether. The whole party was known as the Kharijites
(Kh&#257;rijiyya or Khaw&#257;rij). The Moslems who disagreed with
them were regarded by them as renegades and were to be put to
death. They were soon divided into extremists and moderates.
The former put to death the children of unbelievers and refused
to hold intercourse in daily life with unbelievers. The moderates,
who came to be known as Ibadites (from their leader &lsquo;Abdallah
ibn &lsquo;Ib&#257;d), would allow the children of unbelievers to grow up,
and would then deal with them according to their choice. In
ordinary life they would mix with all men, but marriage with
other Moslems outside their own ranks was forbidden. These still
remain in Oman, parts of Algeria and East Africa.</p>

<p>Another party, consisting mainly of city Arabs infected with
Persian ideas as to the divinity of the ruler, clung to &lsquo;Al&#299; with
inconvenient affection. They regarded &lsquo;Al&#299; and his descendants
as the only legitimate caliphs, and came to be known as Shi&lsquo;ites
(<i>q.v.</i>). They remain to-day the largest part of Islam outside
orthodoxy. During the Omayyad caliphate (661-750) there
were three centres of religious thought and influence; students
and teachers often passed from one to the other, thus making
universal the teachings which in their origin were due to local
circumstances. These centres were Damascus (the seat of the
caliphate), Medina and the East (Irak, &amp;c.). In Damascus the
court was worldly and indifferent to the interests of Islam. The
early Omayyads were distinguished for their striving after
dominion (<i>mulk</i>). Instead of attempting to propagate Islam,
they tolerated other religions and favoured Christians who were
distinguished as poets (<i>e.g.</i> Akhtal) or officials (John of Damascus),
or men likely to be of use to them in any way. The doctrines
of Christianity began to influence even serious Moslems and to
affect their way of stating Moslem belief. John of Damascus
(d. before 767), the Greek theologian, and his pupil, Theodorus
Abucara (d. 826), have written controversial works on Islam,
from which it seems probable that disputations on subjects pertaining
to religion were held between Christians and Moslems.
Two schools of heretical Moslem sects arose under these influences&mdash;that
of the Murjiites and that of the Qadarites. The
Murjiites (&ldquo;postponers&rdquo;) were so called because they postponed
the judgment of human actions until the Day of Judgment. In
politics they accepted the Omayyads as <i>de facto</i> rulers, since they
were Moslems, and left the judgment of their actions to God. As
theologians they taught that religion consists in belief (<i>im&#257;n</i>) in
the unity of God and in his apostle, and in that alone, consequently
no one who held this faith would perish eternally, though
he had been a sinner. This was opposed to the Kh&#257;rijite
doctrine that the unrepentant sinner would perish eternally,
even though he had professed Islam.</p>

<p>The Qadarites were concerned with the doctrine of predestination
and free-will. So long as Moslems were fighting the
battles of Islam they naturally paid most attention to those
revelations which laid stress on the absolute determination of a
man&rsquo;s destiny by God. They fought with great bravery because
they believed that God had foreordained their death or life and
they could not escape His will. In the quieter realm of town and
court life and in their disputations with Christians they were
called upon to reconcile this belief with the appeals made in the
Koran to man&rsquo;s own self-determination to good, to courage, &amp;c.
Mahomet was not a systematic theologian and had done nothing
to help them. The Qadarites declared that man had power over
his own actions. But the teaching of predestination had gained
too great a hold on Moslems to be thus displaced. The teaching
of the Qadarites was held to be heresy, and one of its first professors,
Ma&lsquo;bad ul-Juh&#257;n&#299;, was put to death in 699.<a name="fa3g" id="fa3g" href="#ft3g"><span class="sp">3</span></a> During
this period Medina was the home of tradition. Those who had
been in closest relation with the Prophet dwelt there. The very
people of the city derived a certain splendour and authority
from the fact that Mahomet had lived and was buried there.
Free thought in religion had little chance of arising, less of expressing
itself, in the holy city. But the Koran was diligently
studied, traditions were collected (and invented) though not yet
written in books, and innovation (<i>bid&lsquo;a</i>) was resolutely avoided.
At the same time it really did contribute a new element to
religious practice, for the custom (<i>ijm&#257;&lsquo;</i>, see above) of Medina
gained a certain authority even in Syria and the East.</p>

<p>In the East, on the other hand, there was more mental activity,
and the religious teachers who came from Medina had to be prepared
to meet with many questions. The wits of the Moslems
were sharpened by daily contact with Christians, Buddhists,
Manichaeans and Zoroastrians. &#7716;asan ul-Ba&#7779;r&#299; (<i>q.v.</i>), who has
been claimed as one of the first mystics, also as one of the first
systematic theologians of Islam, was remarkable alike for his
personal piety and his orthodoxy. Yet it was among his pupils
that the great rationalist movement originated. Its founder was
W&#257;&#7779;il ibn &lsquo;At&#257;, who separated himself (whence his followers
were called Motazilites, strictly Mu&lsquo;tazilites, &ldquo;Separatists&rdquo;)
from his teacher and founded a school which became numerous
and influential. The Mu&lsquo;tazilites objected to the attributes
of God being considered in any way as entities beside God; they
explained away the anthropomorphisms used in speaking of the
deity; they regarded the Koran as created and as a product of
Mahomet writing under the divine influence. Briefly, they
asserted the supremacy of reason (<i>&lsquo;aql</i>) as distinct from faith
received by tradition (<i>naql</i>). They also called themselves &ldquo;the
people of justice and unity&rdquo; (<i>Ahl ul-&lsquo;adl wat-tau&#7717;&#299;d</i>). Such a
faith as this naturally found favour rather with the thinking
classes than with the uneducated multitude, and so went through
many vicissitudes. At the time of its appearance and until the
reign of Ma&lsquo;m&#363;n its adherents were persecuted as heretics. After
discussions among the theologians Ma&lsquo;m&#363;n took the decided
step of proclaiming that the Koran was created, and that a belief
in this dogma was necessary. Other Mu&lsquo;tazilite doctrines were
proclaimed later. Mu&lsquo;tazilites were appointed to official posts,
and an inquisition (<i>m&#299;&#7717;na</i>) was appointed to enforce belief in their
doctrines. This movement was strongly opposed by the orthodox
and especially by A&#7717;mad ibn Hanbal (<i>q.v.</i>). By him the founding
of theology on reason was rejected, and he suffered persecution
for his faith (see W. N. Patton, <i>A&#7717;med ibn Hanbal and the Mi&#7717;na</i>,
Leiden, 1897). Mu&lsquo;tazilism retained its sway until 849, when
the caliph Motawakkil again declared the Koran uncreate and
restored orthodoxy. It was during the early years of the Abbasid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page422" id="page422"></a>422</span>
rule that the four legal schools of Ab&#363; Han&#299;fa (d. 767), M&#257;lik ibn
Anas (d. 795), ash-Sh&#257;fi&lsquo;&#299; (d. 819) and Ibn Hanbal (d. 855) came
into existence (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mahommedan Law</a></span>). As the bases of religion
and law were the same, so the methods applied in the treatment of
the one affected the other. Ab&#363; Han&#299;fa depended little on
tradition, but referred back to the Koran, making use of individual
opinion (<i>ra&lsquo;y</i>) as controlled by analogy (<i>q&#299;y&#257;s</i>) with a
written ordinance. M&#257;lik Ibn Anas supplemented the Koran
and Sunna by customary law founded largely on the custom
(<i>ijm&#257;&lsquo;</i>) of Medina, and by what he conceived to be for the public
good (<i>isti&#7779;l&#257;h</i>). Shafi&lsquo;&#299; recognized tradition as equal to the Koran,
and even as being able to supersede its ordinances, while he also
recognized the universal custom (<i>ijm&#257;&lsquo;</i>) of the Moslem world as
divine and binding. His four bases of religion&mdash;Koran, sunna,
qiy&#257;s and ijm&#257;&lsquo;&mdash;have been generally accepted in Islam (see
above). Ibn Hanbal&rsquo;s position has been already mentioned. All
these four schools are reckoned orthodox, and all orthodox
Moslems belong to one or another of them. Another teacher of
this time, who founded a school which did not succeed in being
recognized as orthodox, was D&#257;&lsquo;&#363;d uz-&#7826;&#257;hir&#299;. Trained as a
Shafi&lsquo;ite, he became too strict for this school, rejected analogy,
restricted <i>ijm&#257;&lsquo;</i> to the agreement or custom of the companions
of Mahomet, and accepted the whole of the Koran and tradition
in the most literal and external sense. His followers were called
&#7826;&#257;hirites (<i>i.e.</i> externalists). After Ash&lsquo;ar&#299;&rsquo;s time these principles
were applied to theology by Ibn Hazm (<i>q.v.</i>) see I. Goldziher,
<i>Die Zahiriten, ihr Lehrsystem und ihre Geschichte</i> (Leipzig, 1884).</p>

<p>Before turning to the reform of Ash&lsquo;ar&#299; and the introduction
into orthodox theology of scholastic philosophy it is necessary to
notice another phase of religious life which became the common
property of orthodox and heretics. This was the introduction
of asceticism in religions practice and of mysticism in religious
thought. Sufi&lsquo;ism (<i>q.v.</i>), which combined these two, is rightly
not counted among the sects of Islam. Asceticism seems to have
won a certain amount of approval from Mahomet himself, who
much respected the Christian monks. The attention paid in early
Islam to the joys and punishments of the future life led to self-denial
and simple living in this world. An Arabian writer, speaking
of the simplicity of manners of the first four caliphs, says
that their affairs were conducted with more consideration of the
future life than of this world. Many Moslems went even farther
than these caliphs, and gave up all concern as far as possible with
the affairs of this world and lived in poverty, in wanderings or in
retirement (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dervish</a></span>). For the historical development of
this movement, with its accompanying mysticism, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sufi&lsquo;ism</a></span>.
Ash&lsquo;ar&#299; (d. before 942) was for forty years a Mu&lsquo;tazilite, then
became orthodox (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ash&lsquo;ar&#299;</a></span>), and at once applied rational
methods for the support and interpretation of the orthodox
faith. Before him, reason had not been allowed any scope in
orthodox theology. He was not the first to use it; some teachers
(as al-Junaid) had employed it in teaching, but only in secret and
for the few. The methods of scholastic philosophy were now
introduced into Moslem theology. The chief characteristic of
his religious teaching was the adoption of the <i>via media</i> between
materialistic grossness and the ideas of pure speculative philosophy.
Thus he taught, as to the attributes of God, that they
exist, but are not to be compared with human attributes; as to
His visibility, that He can be seen but without the limitations of
human sight. As to the great question of free will, he denied man&rsquo;s
power but asserted his responsibility. So he passed in review
the doctrines of God, faith, the Koran, sin, intercession, &amp;c.,
and for the first time in the history of Islam produced a
systematic theology. The teaching of Ash&lsquo;ar&#299; was taken up and
propagated by the Buyids soon after his death, and was developed
and perfected by Ab&#363; Bekr ul-B&#257;qil&#257;n&#299;, the Cadi (d. 1012), but
up to the middle of the 5th century of Islam (<i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1058) was
suspected elsewhere and confounded with Mu&lsquo;tazilism. The
Ash&lsquo;ar&#299;te al-Juwain&#299; (known as Im&#257;m ul-Haramain) was persecuted
under Toghrul Beg (<i>c.</i> 1053) and exiled, but was restored
under Alp Arslan by the vizier Ni&#7827;&#257;m ul-Mulk, who founded an
Ash&lsquo;arite college (the Ni&#7827;&#257;miyya). In the West, Ibn Hazm (<i>q.v.</i>)
fiercely opposed the system, but Ghaz&#257;l&#299; established its orthodoxy
in the East, and it spread from Persia to Syria and Egypt under
the Ayy&#363;bites and Mamelukes and thence to the Almohades in
Africa under Ibn Tumart (1130). It remains the predominating
influence to the present day, its only serious rival being the
theological system of al-Mat&#257;rid&#299;, a Hanifite (d. 945), whose creed
as represented in that of an-Nasaf&#299; is still used largely by the
Turks. Since the 12th century no great theological movement
has been made in Islam. The quiet of religious life has twice
been broken, once by Wahh&#257;bism (<i>q.v.</i>) in Arabia, once by B&#257;bism
(<i>q.v.</i>) in Persia.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><span class="sc">The Sects</span></p>

<p>According to an early tradition Mahomet said that Islam
would be divided into seventy-three parties (sects),<a name="fa4g" id="fa4g" href="#ft4g"><span class="sp">4</span></a> of which
seventy-two would perish and one would be saved. The orthodox
Arabian writers on heretical sects of Islam feel compelled by this
tradition to make up their number to seventy-two, and, as
different writers adopt different divisions or are familiar with
different parties, the names of sects amount to some hundreds.
Each writer, however, adopts certain main classes under which
he attempts to group the others. Ab&#363; Mu&#7789;&#299;&lsquo; Makh&#363;l at the
beginning of the 10th century in his &ldquo;Refutation&rdquo; (MS. in
Bodleian Library) has six such chief classes: &#7716;ar&#363;rites (<i>i.e.</i>
Kh&#257;rijites), R&#257;fi&#7693;ites (<i>i.e.</i> Shi&lsquo;ites), Qadarites, Jabarites,
Jahmites and Murjiites. Ibn Hazm (<i>q.v.</i>) adopts four classes:
Mu&lsquo;tazilites (Motazilites), Murjiites, Shi&lsquo;ites and Kh&#257;rijites.
Shahrast&#257;n&#299; (<i>q.v.</i>) complains of the want of system in earlier
writers, and suggests as bases of classification the position of
parties with regard to the doctrines as to (1) the divine attributes,
(2) predestination and free-will (3) promises and threats, faith
and error, (4) revelation, reason, the im&#257;mate. In one part of his
preface he gives as the chief parties the Qadarites, &#7778;if&#257;tites,
Kh&#257;rijites and Shi&lsquo;ites, proposing to divide these classes according
to leaders who agreed with the main doctrines of their class
but differed in some points. In another place he mentions four
opposite pairs of sects: (1) the Qadarites with their doctrine of
free-will, and the Jabarites, who are necessitarians; (2) the
&#7778;if&#257;tites, who maintain the eternal nature of the attributes of
God, and the Mu&lsquo;tazilites, who deny it; (3) the Murjiites, who
postpone judgment of actions until the Last Day, and the
W&#257;&lsquo;idites, who condemn in this life; (4) the Kh&#257;rijites, who
consider the caliphate a human institution, and the Shi&lsquo;ites, who
deify their ruler. In his detailed treatment of the sects Shahrast&#257;n&#299;
arranged them under the headings: Mu&lsquo;tazilites, Jabarites,
&#7778;if&#257;tites, Kh&#257;rijites, Murjiites and Shi&lsquo;ites. About the same
time as Shahrast&#257;n&#299; two other Arabian writers wrote on the sects&mdash;&#7788;&#257;hir
ul-Isfarain&#299; (d. 1078), whose MS. is in the Berlin library,
and &lsquo;Abd ul-Q&#257;dir ul-J&#299;l&#257;n&#299; (1078-1166) in his <i>Kit&#257;b ul-Ghan&#299;yya
li-T&#257;lib&#299; Tar&#299;q il-Haqqi</i> (Cairo, 1871). Both adopt as main
classes R&#257;fi&#7693;ites (or Shi&lsquo;ites), Qadarites (or Mu&lsquo;tazilites), Kh&#257;rijites,
Murjiites, Najj&#257;rites, Dir&#257;rites, Jahmites, Mushabbiha, to
which &#7788;&#257;hir adds Bakrites, Karr&#257;mites, and a class including
those sects which are not reckoned as Moslem though they have
sprung from Islam. J&#299;l&#257;n&#299; adds to the eight the Kil&#257;bites.</p>

<p>The following list is not a complete list of names of sects but is
founded on that of Shahrast&#257;n&#299;.<a name="fa5g" id="fa5g" href="#ft5g"><span class="sp">5</span></a></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Af&#7789;a&#7717;ites.</i>&mdash;Shi&lsquo;ites of the Im&#257;mite class, who ascribe the im&#257;mate
to &lsquo;Abdallah ul-Af&#7789;a&#7717;i, the son of &#7778;&#257;diq.</p>

<p><i>Aj&#257;rida.</i>&mdash;Kh&#257;rijites, followers of Ibn &lsquo;Ajarrad, who agreed for
the most part with the Najad&#257;t (below), considered grave sins as
equivalent to unbelief, but remained friendly with those who professed
Islam but did not fight for it. They rejected <i>sura</i> 7 as a fable.
Shahrast&#257;n&#299; enumerates seven divisions of this sect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page423" id="page423"></a>423</span></p>

<p><i>Akhnasites.</i>&mdash;A section of the Tha&lsquo;&#257;liba not so strict in treatment
of those who fear to fight for Islam.</p>

<p><i>Ash&lsquo;arites.</i>&mdash;Followers of Ash&lsquo;ar&#299; (<i>q.v.</i>) who are counted by Shahrast&#257;n&#299;
among the &#7778;if&#257;tites.</p>

<p><i>A&#7789;r&#257;fites.</i>&mdash;A division of the &lsquo;Aj&#257;rida who agree with the &#7716;amzites
except that they excuse the lower classes for inaction when they are
ignorant of the law.</p>

<p><i>Azraqites.</i>&mdash;Kh&#257;rijites who followed al-Azraq in the days of Ibn
Zubair. They held &lsquo;Ali to be an unbeliever; those who did not fight
were unbelievers; the children of unbelievers were to be put to death
and went to hell. Sin is unbelief.</p>

<p><i>Bahshamites.</i>&mdash;Mu&lsquo;tazilites akin to the Jubb&#257;&lsquo;ites.</p>

<p><i>Baihasites.</i>&mdash;Kh&#257;rijites, followers of Abu Baihas ul-Haitham, who

of knowledge for religion.</p>

<p><i>B&#257;qirites.</i>&mdash;Shi&lsquo;ites who followed Ab&#363; Ja&lsquo;far ul-B&#257;qir, the fifth
im&#257;m, and looked for his return.</p>

<p><i>B&#257;&#7789;inites.</i>&mdash;Isma&lsquo;ilites, so called because they believe that every
external has an internal (<i>b&#257;tin</i>), and every passage in the Koran has
an allegoric meaning.</p>

<p><i>Bishrites.</i>&mdash;Mu&lsquo;tazilites, followers of Bishr ibn Mu&lsquo;tamir, one of
the most learned men of his party. His teaching was philosophical
and was distinguished by his doctrine of &ldquo;origination&rdquo; (<i>tawallud</i>).</p>

<p><i>Bun&#257;nites.</i>&mdash;Kais&#257;nites, followers of Bun&#257;n ibn Sim&lsquo;&#257;n un-Nahd&#299;,

and that he had also acquired the divine element of &lsquo;Al&#299;.</p>

<p><i>Butrites.</i>&mdash;Zaidites, followers of Kath&#299;r un-Naw&#257; ul-Abtar, who
agreed with the Suleimanites (Sulaim&#257;nites) except that he suspended
judgment as to whether Othm&#257;n was a believer or not.</p>

<p><i>&#7692;ir&#257;rites.</i>&mdash;Jabarites who empty God of his attributes, and assert
that man has a sixth sense by which he will see God on the day of
resurrection. The actions of man are &ldquo;created&rdquo; and acquired by
him. A caliph need not be chosen from the Koreish.</p>

<p><i>Gh&#257;liites</i> (Ghul&#257;) are the extreme Shi&lsquo;ites (<i>q.v.</i>) in ascribing deity
to the im&#257;ms. Their heresies are said to be four in number: (1)
Making God resemble man, (2) ascribing change of mind to God,
(3) looking for the return of the im&#257;m, (4) metempsychosis. They
are divided by Shahrast&#257;n&#299; into ten classes.</p>

<p><i>Ghass&#257;nites.</i>&mdash;Murjiites, followers of Ghass&#257;n ibn ul-Kuf&#299;, who say
that faith consists of knowledge of God, his apostle, and the Koran
in general not in detail, and that faith increases but is not diminished.</p>

<p><i>&#7716;abities</i> = &#7716;&#257;yitites (below).</p>

<p><i>&#7716;adathites</i> (&#7716;udabites) are Mu&lsquo;tazilites, followers of Fa&#7693;l ibn

ibn ul-&#7716;anafiyya, although they held that his father had gone
astray.</p>

<p><i>H&#257;shwiites.</i>&mdash;A party who asserted the eternity even of the letters
of the Koran. They are not mentioned as a separate sect by Shahrast&#257;n&#299;;
cf. van Vloten, &ldquo;<i>Les Hachwia et Nabita</i>,&rdquo; in the <i>Acts of the
11th Oriental Congress</i> (Paris, 1899), pt. iii., pp. 99 sqq.</p>

<p><i>&#7716;&#257;yi&#7789;ites.</i>&mdash;Mu&lsquo;tazilites who agreed with the Na&#7827;&#7827;&#257;mites, but
added three heresies of their own: (1) the divinity of the Messiah,
(2) metempsychosis, (3) the interpretation of all references to the
vision of God as referring to the &ldquo;first Reason&rdquo; or &ldquo;creative
Reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Hish&#257;mites.</i>&mdash;A name given to two sects: (1) Mu&lsquo;tazilites, strong
in their assertion of man&rsquo;s free-will, even opposing the statement
of the Koran. (2) Shi&lsquo;ites of the extreme kind, who attributed to
God a body with quantities (measurements) and qualities.</p>

are given by Shahrast&#257;n&#299;.</p>

<p><i>Iba&#7693;ites.</i>&mdash;Kh&#257;rijites of moderate tendencies (see above).</p>

<p><i>Ilb&#257;ites.</i>&mdash;Gh&#257;liites who put &lsquo;Al&#299; above Mahomet and blamed the
latter because he called men to himself instead of to &lsquo;Al&#299;.</p>

<p><i>Im&#257;mites.</i>&mdash;One of the chief divisions of the Shi&lsquo;ites (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p><i>Is&#7717;&#257;qites.</i>&mdash;Gh&#257;liites agreeing with the Nu&#7779;airites except that
they incline to speak of the imams&rsquo; participation in the prophetic

(<i>q.v.</i>), who indulged in philosophical speculations, believed in the
eternity of matter, and was regarded as a naturalist (<i>&#7789;aba&lsquo;&#299;</i>) rather
than a theist (<i>allah&#299;</i>).</p>

<p><i>Jahmites.</i>&mdash;Jabarites, followers of Jahm ibn &#7778;afw&#257;n, who was
put to death at Merv toward the close of the Omayyad period. He

<p><i>J&#257;r&#363;dites.</i>&mdash;Zaidites who held that Mahomet designated &lsquo;Al&#299; as

<p><span class="bold">MAHONY, FRANCIS SYLVESTER<a name="ar39" id="ar39"></a></span> (1804-1866), known as
&ldquo;Father Prout,&rdquo; Irish priest and author, son of a woollen manufacturer,
was born in Cork in 1804. His classical education was
chiefly obtained at a Jesuit college at Amiens, and after studying
in Paris he entered the Jesuit college at Rome and was admitted
into the Society of Jesus. He served in Switzerland and at
Clongoweswood, Ireland, where he was prefect of studies and
subsequently master of rhetoric. Here he was involved in
scandals that led to his resignation. On going to Italy he was
told at Florence that he was expelled from the Society. He
succeeded, however, in obtaining priest&rsquo;s orders at Rome in 1832,
and returned to Ireland, but subsequently went to London,
officiating for some time in the chapel of the Bavarian Legation.
While there he fell in with William Maginn, and about 1834
began to contribute his celebrated &ldquo;Prout Papers&rdquo; to <i>Fraser&rsquo;s
Magazine</i>. These consist of episodes in the life of the parish
priest &ldquo;Father Prout,&rdquo; and dialogues after the model of &ldquo;Christopher
North,&rdquo; varied by translations of well-known English
songs into Latin, Greek, French and Italian verse, which he
humorously represents as being the true originals from which the
English authors had merely plagiarized them. Mahony&rsquo;s translations
have been universally admired for the extraordinary
command which they display of the various languages into which
his renderings are made, and for their spirit and freedom both of
thought and expression. His original verse tends chiefly to show
that with all his sarcastic and cynical wit his genius had also its
tender, serious and sentimental side. His &ldquo;Bells of Shandon&rdquo;
has always been greatly admired. In 1846 Mahony became
correspondent at Rome to the <i>Daily News</i>, and his letters from
that capital gave very vivid pictures of the first years of the reign
of Pius IX. The last twelve or fifteen years of his life were spent
in Paris, whence he supplied the <i>Globe</i> with a series of piquant
letters on the incidents of the day. He died in Paris on the
18th of May 1866.</p>

<p>The <i>Reliques of Father Prout</i> were collected from <i>Fraser&rsquo;s Magazine</i>
and published in two volumes in 1836; <i>The Final Reliques of Father
Prout</i>, chiefly extracted from the <i>Daily News</i> and the <i>Globe</i>, were
edited by Blanchard Jerrold in 1876, and an edition of his works,
edited by Charles Kent, was published in 1881.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAHRATTAS<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span>, a people of India, inhabiting the district known
by the ancient name of Maharashtra (Sans. &ldquo;great kingdom or
region&rdquo;). This large tract, extending from the Arabian Sea on
the west to the S&#257;tpura mountains in the north, comprises a good
part of western and central India, including the modern provinces
of the Konkan, Khandesh, Berar, the British Deccan, part of
Nagpur, and about half the nizam&rsquo;s Deccan.</p>

<p>The etymology of the word Mahratta (<i>Mar&#257;th&#257;</i>) is uncertain.
The name does not indicate a social caste, or a religious sect; it
is not even tribal. Strictly, it is confined to the upper class
from whom Sivaji&rsquo;s generals were mostly drawn, and who sometimes
claim a Rajput origin. In a wider sense it may be extended
to include all who inhabit Maharashtra and speak
Mahratti as their mother-tongue. In 1901 the total number of
speakers of Mahratti in all India exceeded 18 millions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page425" id="page425"></a>425</span></p>

<p>The Mahrattas have always been a separate nation or people,
and still regard themselves as such, though nowadays they are
almost all under British or Mahommedan jurisdiction; that
is, they belong either to British India or to the nizam&rsquo;s dominions.
There are indeed still three large native states nominally
Mahratta: that of Sindhia near the borders of Hindustan in the
north, that of Holkar in Malwa in the heart of the Indian continent,
and that of the gaekwar in Gujarat on the western coast.
But in these states the prince, his relatives and some of his
ministers or officials only are Mahrattas; the mass of the people
belong to other sections of the Hindu race. These states then
are not to be included in the Mahratta nation, though they have
a share in Mahratta history.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In general terms the Mahrattas, in the wider sense, may be
described under two main heads: first the Brahmans, and secondly
the low-caste men. The Mahratta Brahmans possess, in an intense
degree, the qualities of that famous caste, physical, intellectual and
moral. They have generally the lofty brow, the regular features,
the spare upright figure, and the calm aspect which might be
expected in a race maintained in great purity yet upon a broad
basis. In modern times they have proved themselves the most
able and ambitious of all the Brahmans in the Indian Empire.
They are notably divided into two sections: the Konkanast, coming
from the Konkan or littoral tract on the west coast below the
Western Gh&#257;t mountains; and the Deshast, coming from the
uplands or Deccan, on the east of the mountains. Though there
have been many distinguished Deshasts, yet the most remarkable
of all have been Konkanasts. For instance, the p&#275;shwas, or heads
of the Mahratta confederation which at one time dominated nearly
all India, were Konkanast Brahmans. The birthplaces of these
persons are still known, and to this day there are sequestered
villages, nestling near the western base of the Gh&#257;ts, which are
pointed to as being the ancestral homes of men who two centuries
ago had political control over half India.</p>

<p>Apart from the Brahmans, the Mahrattas may be generally
designated as S&#363;dras, the humblest of the four great castes into
which the Hindu race is theoretically divided. But the upper
classes claim to be Kshattriyas or Rajputs. They probably are
aborigines fundamentally, with a mixture of what are now called
the Scythian tribes, which at a very early time overran India.
The ordinary Mahrattas, who form the backbone of the nation,
have plain features, an uncouth manner, short stature, a small but
wiry frame. Though not powerful physically as compared with the
northern races of the Punjab and Oudh, they have much activity
and an unsurpassed endurance. Born and bred in or near the
Western Gh&#257;t mountains and the numerous tributary ranges, they
have all the qualities of mountaineers. In recent times they enter
military service less and less, betaking themselves mainly to cultivation
and to the carrying business connected with agriculture.
As husbandmen they are not remarkable; but as graziers, as cartmen,
as labourers, they are excellent. As artisans they have seldom
signalized themselves, save as armourers and clothweavers.</p>

<p>In the Konkan there are some superior proprietors termed
Khots. With this and perhaps some other exceptions, there
are not in the Mahratta country many large landlords, nor many
of the superior tenure-holders whose position relatively to that of
the peasantry has caused much discussion in other parts of India.
There are indeed many Mahratta chiefs still resident in the country,
members of the aristocracy which formerly enjoyed much wealth
and power. They are sometimes in the position of landlords, but
often they are the assignees of the land revenue, which they are
entitled under special grants to collect for themselves instead of
for government, paying merely a small sum to Government by way
of quit-rent. Under them the cultivators are by British arrangements
placed in the position of peasant proprietors. The village community
has always existed as the social unit in the Mahratta territories,
though with less cohesion among its members than in the village communities
of Hindustan and the Punjab. The ancient offices pertaining
to the village, as those of the headmen (<i>patel</i>), the village accountant,
&amp;c., are in working order throughout the Mahratta country.</p>

<p>The Mahratta peasantry possess manly fortitude under suffering
and misfortune. Though patient and good-tempered in the main,
they have a latent warmth of temper, and if oppressed beyond a
certain limit they would fiercely turn upon their tormentors. As a
rule they are orderly and law-abiding, but traditions of plunder
have been handed down to them from early times, and many of
them retain the predatory instincts of their forefathers. The
neighbourhood of dense forests, steep hill-sides, and fastnesses
hard of access offers extraordinary facilities to plunderers for
screening themselves and their booty. Thus gang robbery is apt
to break out, gains head with rapidity, and is suppressed with
difficulty. In times of peace it is kept under, but during war, or
whenever the bands of civil order are loosened, it becomes a cause
of anxiety and a source of danger. The women have frankness and
strength of character; they work hard in the fields, and as a rule
evince domestic virtue.</p>

<p>The peasantry preserve a grave and quiet demeanour, but they
have their humble ideas of gaiety, and hold their gatherings on
occasions of births or marriages. They frequently beguile their
toil with carols. They like the gossiping and bartering at the rural
markets and in the larger fairs, which are sometimes held in strikingly
picturesque localities. They are superstitious, and worship with
hearty veneration any being or thing whose destructive agency
they fear. They even speak of the tiger with honorific titles.
They are Hindus, but their Hinduism is held to be of a non-Aryan
type. They are sincerely devout in religion, and feel an awe
regarding &ldquo;the holy Brahmans,&rdquo; holding the life and the person
of a Brahman sacred, even though he be a criminal of the deepest
dye. They of course regard the cow as equally sacred. There
are two principal sects among modern Hindus&mdash;those who follow
Vishnu, and those who follow Siva. The Mahrattas generally
follow Siva and his wife, a dread goddess known under many names.
The Mahratta war-cry, &ldquo;Har, Har, Mahadeo,&rdquo; referred to Siva.
All classes high and low are fond of the religious festivals, the
principal of which, the Dasahra, occurs in October, when the first
harvest of the year has been secured and the second crops sown.
This has always been held with the utmost pomp and magnificence
at every centre of Mahratta wealth and power. The people frequently
assemble in bowers and arbours constructed of leafy boughs to hear
kathas recited. These recitations are partly religious, partly also
romantic and quasi-historical. After them national resolves of just
resistance or of aggressive ambition have often been formed.</p>

<p>Apart from the Mahratta Brahmans, as already mentioned, the
Mahratta nobles and princes are not generally fine-looking men.
There is general truth in what was once said by a high authority
to the effect that, while there will be something dignified in the
humblest R&#257;jp&#363;t, there will be something mean in the highest
Mahratta. Bluff good-nature, a certain jocoseness, a humour
pungent and ready, though somewhat coarse, a hot or even violent
disposition, are characteristics of Mahratta chieftains. They usually
show little aptitude for business or for sedentary pursuits; but, on
the other hand, they are born equestrians and sportsmen. Mahratta
ladies and princesses have often taken a prominent part, for good or
evil, in public affairs and dynastic intrigues.</p>

<p>Though they have produced some poetry, the Mahrattas have
never done much for literature. Nor have they been distinguished
in industrial art. Their architecture in wood, however, was excellent;
and the teak forests of their country afforded the finest timber for
building and for carving. They had also much skill in the construction
of works for the supply of drinking water on a large scale
and for irrigation.</p>
</div>

<p>The range of the Western Gh&#257;ts enabled the Mahrattas to
rise against their Mahommedan conquerors, to reassert their
Hindu nationality against the whole power of the Mogul Empire,
and to establish in its place an empire of their own. It is often
stated that in India British conquest or annexation succeeded
Mahommedan rule; and to a considerable extent this was the
case. But, on the other hand, the principal power, the widest
sovereignty, which the British overthrew in India was that of the
Mahrattas.</p>

<p>During the earlier Moslem invasions in 1100 and in subsequent
years, the Mahrattas do not seem to have made much resistance.
They submitted to several Mahommedan kings under the changing
circumstances of those times. It was against the Mahommedan
king of Bijapur in the Deccan that Sivaji, the hero of
Mahratta history, first rebelled in 1657. Sivaji and his fighting
officers were Mahrattas of humble caste, but his ministers were
Brahmans. When the Mogul Empire absorbed the Bijapur
kingdom he defied the emperor. He imparted a self-reliant
enthusiasm to his countrymen, formed them into an army, and
organized them as a political community; his mountaineer
infantry, though limited in numbers, proved desperately courageous;
his cavalry was daring and ubiquitous. The Moslems,
having once overcome the Hindus in almost all parts of India,
had not for centuries met with any noteworthy uprising. Sivaji,
however, planned their expulsion, and before the end of his restless
life made much progress in the execution of that design.
The new state which he founded was maintained under various
vicissitudes after his death. Mahratta resistance, once aroused
by him, was never extinguished, and the imperial resources
were worn out by ceaseless though vain efforts to quell it.
The great Mogul emperor&rsquo;s impoverished and enfeebled successor
was fain to recognize the Mahratta state by a formal instrument.
The Mahratta king, a descendant of Sivaji, had become a <i>roi
fainéant</i>, and the arrangement was negotiated by his Brahman
minister, whose official designation was the p&#275;shwa. The office
of p&#275;shwa then became hereditary in the minister&rsquo;s family,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page426" id="page426"></a>426</span>
and grew in importance as the Mahratta kingdom rose, while the
king sunk into the condition of a puppet. Thus the Mahratta
power was consolidated throughout nearly the whole of Maharashtra
under the Brahman p&#275;shwa as virtual sovereign, with his
capital at Poona, while the titular Mahratta raja or king had
his court at the neighbouring city of Satara. Despite his political
importance, however, the raja was still venerated as the
descendant of Sivaji.</p>

<p>Then several chiefs carved out principalities of their own from
among the ruins of the Mogul Empire. Thus Raghoji Bhonsla
established himself in the tracts lying underneath the southern
base of the Satpura range (namely, Nagpur and Berar), overran
Orissa and entered Bengal. Damaji Gaekwar descended from
the Western Gh&#257;ts upon the alluvial plains of Gujarat around
Baroda; Tukoji Holkar subdued the uplands of Malwa beyond
the Vindhya range on the north bank of the Nerbudda; and
Mahadji Sindhia obtained possession of large tracts immediately
south of Agra and Delhi, marched into Hindustan and became
virtually the master of the Mogul emperor himself (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gwalior</a></span>).
Sivaji&rsquo;s own father had founded a dominion at Tanjore in the
extreme south, which, however, never had relations with the
central power at Poona. The same may be said of the state of
Kolhapur, allotted to a younger branch of Sivaji&rsquo;s family.</p>

<p>But these principalities, though independent respecting
internal administration, and making war or peace with their
neighbours according to opportunity, owned allegiance to the
p&#275;shwa at Poona as the head of the Mahratta race. On state
occasions heads of principalities would visit Poona by way of
acknowledging the superior position of the p&#275;shwa. On the
other hand, the p&#275;shwa was careful to obtain the sanction of his
nominal sovereign at Satara to every important act of state.
Thus a confederation was formed of which the Brahman p&#275;shwa
or head was at Poona, governing the adjacent territories, while
the members, belonging to the lower castes, were scattered
throughout the continent of India. Such was the Mahratta
Empire which supplanted the Mogul Empire. The Mahratta
power grew and prospered till it embraced all western and most
of central India. Its culminating point was reached about
1750, or about a century after Sivaji first rebelled against his
Mahommedan sovereign.</p>

<p>Its armies drew soldiers from all parts of India. The infantry
was not of good quality; but its cavalry was really an enormous
force, numbering fully a hundred thousand in all. The horsemen
were splendidly audacious in riding for long distances into the
heart of a hostile country, without support, striking some terrific
blows, and then returning rapidly beyond reach of pursuit. They
could truly boast of having watered their horses in every Indian
river from the Cauvery to the Indus. If attacked, however, in
a competent manner, they would not stand; and afterwards, in
conflict with the British, whole masses of them behaved in a
dastardly manner. As their ambition grew the chiefs began to
organize their troops after the system learnt from the English
and French. In this way several Frenchmen&mdash;Benoit de Boigne,
Perron and others&mdash;rose in the Mahratta service to a position
dangerous to the British. But the new system was unsuited to
the Mahratta genius; it hampered the meteoric movements of
the cavalry, which was obliged to man&oelig;uvre in combination
with the new artillery and the disciplined battalions. Mahratta
elders hence uttered predictions of military disaster which were
in the end more than fulfilled.</p>

<p>The rapid and amazing success of the Mahratta confederation
rendered it the largest Hindu power that ever existed in India.
But it lacked the elements of true greatness. It was founded
by plundering expeditions, and its subsequent existence was
tainted by the baseness of this predatory origin. With the
exception of the p&#275;shwas, its chiefs were little more than free-booting
warriors, for the most part rude, violent and unlettered.
Their custom was to offer their neighbours or victims the alternative
of paying <i>chouth</i>, that is, one-fourth of the revenue, or
being plundered and ravaged. Thus the Mahratta <i>chouth</i> came
to have an ominous significance in Indian history. Desultory
efforts were made to establish a civil government, but in the
main there was no administration formed on statesmanlike
principles. The p&#275;shwas, on the other hand, as Brahmans, were
men of the highest education then possible in India. But they
were absorbed by the direction of military and political combinations,
and by intrigues for the preservation of their own
power; and, even allowing for all this, they failed to evince the
civil capacity which might have been anticipated. While
several displayed commanding abilities, and some possessed
many virtues, one alone attempted to conduct an administration
in an enlightened manner, and he died prematurely.</p>

<p>There were at the same time powers existing in India to keep
the Mahrattas in check, and some parts of India were excepted
from their depredations. The English power was rising at
Calcutta, Madras and Bombay. The nascent Sikh power
prevented Mahratta incursions from being permanently successful
in the Punjab. As the Mogul Empire broke up, some separate
Mahommedan powers rose upon its ruins. The nizam of the
Deccan established himself at Hyderabad, comparatively near
the headquarters of the p&#275;shwa. Hyder Ali was proclaimed
sultan of Mysore in the south. Ahmed Shah Abdali burst upon
India from Afghanistan. The Mahrattas bravely encountered
him at Panipat near Delhi in 1761, and were decisively defeated.
The defeat, however, did not essentially shake the Mahratta
confederation. It was collision with the English that broke that
wonderful fabric to pieces.</p>

<p>The first collision with the English occurred in 1775, arising
from a disputed succession to the p&#275;shwaship. The English
government at Bombay supported one of the claimants, and the
affair became critical for the English as well as for the Mahrattas.
It was at this conjuncture that Warren Hastings displayed his
political genius and rendered signal service to his country, by
succouring from Bengal the defeated Bombay army and negotiating
a peace (in 1782) that restored the <i>status quo</i>.</p>

<p>The next collision happened in 1803. The p&#275;shwa had fallen
into grave difficulties with some of the principal members of the
Mahratta confederation. He therefore placed himself under
British protection, and this led to the great Mahratta War, in
which the Marquis Wellesley displayed those talents for military
and political combination which rendered him illustrious. It
was during the campaigns which ensued that General Arthur
Wellesley defeated Sindhia and the Bhonsla raja at Assaye, and
General Lake won the victories of Farrukhabad, D&#299;g and Laswari
over Sindhia and Holkar. The three confederates, Sindhia,
Holkar and the Bhonsla, concluded peace with the British
government, after making large sacrifices of territory in favour
of the victor, and submitting to British control politically. It
was during these events that the British won the province of
Orissa, the old Hindustan afterwards part of the North-Western
Provinces, and a part of the western coast in Gujarat.</p>

<p>The third collision came to pass between 1816 and 1818, through
the conduct, not only of the confederates, but also of the p&#275;shwa
(Baji Bao) himself. During the previous war the p&#275;shwa had been
the protégé and ally of the British; and since the war he had fallen
more completely than before under British protection&mdash;British
political officers and British troops being stationed at his capital.
He apparently felt encouraged by circumstances to rebel.
Holkar and the Bhonsla committed hostile acts. The predatory
Pindaris offered a formidable resistance to the British troops.
So the p&#275;shwa ventured to take part in the combination against
the British power, which even yet the Mahrattas did not despair
of overthrowing. After long-protracted menaces, he attacked the
British at Kirkee, but failed utterly, and fled a ruined man.
Ultimately he surrendered to Sir John Malcolm, and was sent as
a state pensioner to Bith&#363;r, near Cawnpore. The British, however,
released the raja of Satara from the captivity in which he
had been kept during the p&#275;shwa&rsquo;s time, and reinstated him
on the throne, with a limited territory. Owing to these
events the British government became possessed of the Konkan
and of the greater part of the Deccan.</p>

<p>It remains to mention briefly the fortunes of each remaining
member of the once imperial confederation. The principality
of Satara was held to have lapsed in 1848 by the death of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427"></a>427</span>
raja without lineal heirs, and was annexed by the British government.
The Bhonsla raja of Nagpur died without lineal heirs in
1853, and his territory was likewise annexed. The house of
Holkar remained faithful to its engagements with the British
government, and its position as a feudatory of the empire was
maintained. In Sindhia&rsquo;s territory, by reason of internal feuds,
the British had to undertake measures which were successfully
terminated after the battles of Maharajpur and Panniar in 1843.
But on the whole the house of Sindhia remained faithful.
Sindhia himself was actively loyal during the Mutiny. The gaekwar
gradually fell under British control towards the close of the
18th century, and his house never engaged in hostilities with the
British government. The ex-p&#275;shwa lived to old age at Bithur,
and died in 1857. His adopted son grew up to be the Nana
Sahib, of infamous memory, who took a leading part in the
Mutiny.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAHSEER,<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Mahaseer</span> (<i>Barbus mosal</i>), a kind of barbel,
abundant in the rivers of India, especially in pools of the upper
and more rapid streams where they issue from the mountainous
part of the country. It is one of the largest species of the
Cyprinid family, attaining to a length of 3 to 5 ft., and sometimes
exceeding a weight of 70 &#8468;. Its body is well-proportioned, rather
elongate, and somewhat like that of the European barbel, but
covered with very large scales, of which there are only twenty-five
or twenty-seven placed along the lateral line; the dorsal
fin is armed with a long and strong spine, and the mouth provided
with four slender and short barbels. The lips are sometimes
produced into fleshy lobes. To the fisherman in India the
mahseer affords the same kind of sport as the salmon in the
British Isles, and it rivals that fish as regards size, strength and
activity. Its flesh is likewise much esteemed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAI, ANGELO<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> (1782-1854), Italian cardinal and philologist,
was born of humble parents at Schilpario in the province of Bergamo,
Lombardy, on the 7th of March 1782. In 1799 he entered
the Society of Jesus, and in 1804 he became a teacher of classics
in the college of Naples. After completing his studies at the
Collegium Romanum, he lived for some time at Orvieto, where
he was engaged in teaching and palaeographical studies. The
political events of 1808 necessitated his withdrawal from Rome
(to which he had meanwhile returned) to Milan, where in 1813
he was made custodian of the Ambrosian library. He now
threw himself with characteristic energy and zeal into the task
of examining the numerous MSS. committed to his charge, and
in the course of the next six years was able to restore to the world
a considerable number of long-lost works. Having withdrawn
from the Society of Jesus, he was invited to Rome in 1819 as
chief keeper of the Vatican library. In 1833 he was transferred
to the office of secretary of the congregation of the Propaganda;
on the 12th of February 1838 he was raised to the dignity of
cardinal. He died at Castelgandolfo, near Albano, on the 8th of
September 1854.</p>

<p>It is on his skill as a reader of palimpsests that Mai&rsquo;s fame
chiefly rests. To the period of his residence at Milan belong:
Fragments of Cicero&rsquo;s <i>Pro Scauro, Pro Tullio, Pro Flacco, In
Clodium et Curionem, De aere alieno Milonis, De rege</i> (<i>Alexandrino</i>
(1814); <i>M. Corn. Frontonis opera inedita, cum epistolis item
ineditis, Antonini Pii, Marci Aurelii, Lucii Veri et Appiani</i>
(1815; new ed., 1823, with more than 100 additional letters found
in the Vatican library); portions of eight speeches of Quintus
Aurelius Symmachus; fragments of Plautus; the oration of Isaeus
<i>De hereditate Cleonymi</i>; the last nine books of the <i>Antiquities</i>
of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and a number of other works. <i>M.
Tullii Ciceronis de republica quae supersunt</i> appeared at Rome
in 1822; <i>Scriptorum veterum nova collectio, e vaticanis codicibus
edita</i> in 1825-1838; <i>Classici scriptores e vaticanis codicibus editi</i> in
1828-1838; <i>Spicilegium romanum</i> in 1839-1844; and <i>Patrum
nova bibliotheca</i> in 1845-1853. His edition of the celebrated
<i>Codex vaticanus</i>, completed in 1838, but not published (ostensibly
on the ground of inaccuracies) till four years after his death
(1858), is the least satisfactory of his labours and was superseded
by the edition of Vercellone and Cozza (1868), which itself leaves
much to be desired. Although Mai was not as successful
in textual criticism as in the decipherment of manuscripts, he
will always be remembered as a laborious and persevering
pioneer, by whose efforts many ancient writings have been
rescued from oblivion.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAIDEN,<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Maid</span>, a young unmarried girl. &ldquo;Maid&rdquo; is a
shortened form of &ldquo;maiden,&rdquo; O. Eng. <i>maegden</i>, which represents
a diminutive of a Teutonic word meaning &ldquo;young person,&rdquo; of
either sex. An old English word &ldquo;may,&rdquo; meaning a kinsman
or kinswoman, and also a virgin or girl, represents the original.
In early usage &ldquo;maiden&rdquo; as meaning &ldquo;virgin&rdquo; is frequently
applied to the male sex, thus, in Malory&rsquo;s <i>Morte d&rsquo;Arthur</i>, Sir
Percyvale is called a &ldquo;parfyte clene megden.&rdquo; Apart from the
direct applications of the word to the unmarried state, such as
&ldquo;maiden name,&rdquo; &ldquo;maiden lady,&rdquo; &amp;c., the word is used adjectivally,
implying the preservation of the first state of an object,
or indicating a first effort of any kind. Probably a &ldquo;maiden&rdquo;
fortress is one which has never fallen, though the <i>New English
Dictionary</i> suggests that the various &ldquo;maiden castles&rdquo; in England,
usually ancient earthworks, may have been so called from
being so strong that they could be defended by maidens, and
points out that Edinburgh Castle, called &ldquo;maiden-castle&rdquo; by
William Drummond of Hawthornden (<i>Speech for Edinburgh to
the King</i>), is styled <i>Castrum puellarum</i>, the &ldquo;castle of the
maidens,&rdquo; in Geoffrey of Monmouth. A &ldquo;maiden&rdquo; assize, circuit
or session is one at which there are no prisoners for trial; a
&ldquo;maiden over&rdquo; or &ldquo;maiden&rdquo; in cricket is an over from which
no runs are scored. A &ldquo;maiden speech&rdquo; is the first speech made
by a member of parliament in the house. In the <i>Annual
Register</i> for 1794 (quoted in <i>N.E.D.</i>) the expression, with reference
to Canning&rsquo;s first speech, is said to be &ldquo;according to the
technical language of the house.&rdquo; &ldquo;Maiden&rdquo; is applied to
several objects, to a movable framework or horse for drying and
airing of linen, to a washerwoman&rsquo;s &ldquo;dolly&rdquo; or wooden beater,
to the &ldquo;kirnbaby&rdquo; formed of the last sheaf of corn reaped
which formerly figured in the Scottish harvest homes, and to the
beheading instrument, known as the &ldquo;Scottish maiden&rdquo; (see
below). &ldquo;Maid,&rdquo; apart from its primary sense of an unmarried
woman, is chiefly used for a domestic female servant, usually
with a qualifying word prefixed, such as &ldquo;housemaid,&rdquo; &ldquo;parlour-maid,&rdquo;
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The title of &ldquo;<span class="sc">Maid of Honour</span>&rdquo; is given to an unmarried
lady attached to the personal suite of a queen. The custom of
sending young girls of noble or good birth to the court of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page428" id="page428"></a>428</span>
prince or feudal superior, for the purpose, primarily, of education,
goes back to early feudal times, and is parallel with the
sending of boys to act as pages and squires to the feudal castles.
The regular establishment of maids of honour (<i>filles d&rsquo;honneur</i>)
appears first in the royal court of France. This has usually
been attributed to Anne of Brittany, wife of Charles VIII.;
she had a group of unmarried girls of high rank at her court as
part of her household, in whom she took a lively and parental
interest, educating them and bestowing a dowry upon them on
their marriage. A slightly earlier instance, however, has been
found. When the young Margaret of Austria came to France on
her espousal to Charles VIII., broken by his marriage to Anne
of Brittany, there were in her train several <i>filles d&rsquo;honneur</i>, whose
names appear in the <i>Comptes d&rsquo;argenterie de la reine Marguerite
d&rsquo;Autriche</i>, from 1484-1485 and 1488-1489 (<i>Archives de l&rsquo;empire
K. K. 80 and 81</i> quoted by A. Jal, <i>Dictionnaire critique de
biographie et d&rsquo;histoire</i>). It is from the days of Francis I. that the
<i>chroniques scandaleuses</i> begin which circle round the maids of
honour of the French court. The maids of Catherine de Medici,
celebrated as the &ldquo;flying squadron,&rdquo; <i>l&rsquo;escadron volant</i>, are
familiar from the pages of Pierre de l&rsquo;Estoile (1574-1611) and
Brantôme. Among those whose beauty Catherine used in her
political intrigues, the most famous were Isabelle de Limeuil,
Mlle de Montmorency-Fosseux, known as <i>la belle Fosseuse</i>, and
Charlotte de Baune. The <i>filles d&rsquo;honneur</i>, as an institution, were
suppressed in the reign of Louis XIV., at the instigation of
Mme de Montespan&mdash;who had been one of them&mdash;and their place
was taken by the <i>dames de palais</i>. In the English court, this
custom of attaching &ldquo;maids of honour&rdquo; to the queen&rsquo;s person
was no doubt adopted from France. At the present day a queen
regnant has eight maids of honour, a queen consort four. They
take precedence next after the daughters of barons, and where
they have not by right or courtesy a title of their own, they are
styled &ldquo;Honourable.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">The Scottish Maiden</span> was an instrument of capital punishment
formerly in use in Scotland. It is said to have been invented by
the earl of Morton, who is also said to have been its first victim.
This, however, could not have been the case, as the maiden was
first used at the execution of the inferior agents in the assassination
of Rizzio (1561) and Morton was not beheaded till 1581. The
maiden was practically an early form of guillotine. A loaded blade
or axe moving in grooves was fixed in a frame about ten feet high.
The axe was raised to the full height of the frame and then released,
severing the victim&rsquo;s head from his body. At least 120, suffered
death by the maiden, including the regent Morton, Sir John Gordon
of Haddo, President Spottiswood, the marquis and earl of Argyll.
In 1710 it ceased to be used; it is now preserved in the museum of
the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, in Edinburgh.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAIDENHEAD,<a name="ar49" id="ar49"></a></span> a market town and municipal borough in
the Wokingham parliamentary division of Berkshire, England;
24½ m. W. of London by the Great Western railway. Pop.
(1901), 12,980. Area, 2125 acres. It is pleasantly situated on
and above the west (right) bank of the Thames, and is much
in favour as a residential town and a resort of boating parties.
Though of high antiquity it is wholly modern in appearance,
and a large number of handsome houses have been built in its
vicinity. A beautiful timbered house of the 15th century, however,
survives in Ockwells, a short distance south of the town.
The stone bridge carrying the London road over the Thames
dates from 1772; but the crossing is of ancient importance.
Maidenhead has trade in malt and grain. The borough is
under a mayor, 4 aldermen and 12 councillors.</p>

<p>The history of Maidenhead (Maydenhutt, Maydenhith) is
bound up with that of the ancient bridge. It is not mentioned
in Domesday. Edward I. (1297) gave a grant of pontage in aid
of the bridge, which was almost broken down; similar grants
to the &ldquo;bailiffs and good men of Maydenhithe&rdquo; were made by
succeeding sovereigns. In 1451 Henry VI. incorporated the
gild of the Brethren and Sisters of Maydenhith to provide certain
necessaries for the celebration of Mass and to keep the bridge
in order: the gild, dissolved at the Reformation, was revived
by Elizabeth, who, however, later (1581) substituted for it a
corporation consisting of a warden, bridgemaster, burgesses
and commonalty: the governing charter until the 19th century
was that of James I. (1685) incorporating the town under
the title of the mayor, bridgemaster and burgesses. In 1400
Thomas Holand, earl of Kent, held the bridge in the interests
of the deposed Richard II., but was eventually forced to retire.
In 1643 a meeting took place in the town between Charles I.
and three of his children. In the 18th century a considerable
trade was done in carrying malt, meal and timber in barges
to London: at that time three fairs were held which have now
practically disappeared. The Wednesday market is held under
a charter of Elizabeth (1582).</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">MAID MARIAN,<a name="ar50" id="ar50"></a></span> a personage incorporated in the English
legend of Robin Hood. There is no evidence that she had
originally any connexion with the Robin Hood cycle. She seems
to have been an essential feature of the morris dance, and in
the may-game was paired sometimes with Robin-Hood, but
oftener with Friar Tuck. The well-known pastoral play of
Adam de la Hale, <i>Jeu de Robin et Marion</i>, and the many French
songs on the subject, account for the association of the names.
In the ballads on Robin Hood her name is twice casually mentioned,
but there is a late ballad, by a certain S. G. (F. J.
Child, <i>English and Scottish Ballads</i>, i. 219), which tells how
Maid Marian sought Robin in the forest disguised as a page,
and fought with him for an hour before she recognized him by
his voice. S. G. was perhaps acquainted with the two plays,
written in 1598, of <i>The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl
of Huntingdon</i>, by Anthony Munday and Harry Chettle. In
<i>The Downfall</i> Matilda Fitz Walter escapes from the persecution
of King John by following her lover to Sherwood Forest, where
they took the names of Robin Hood and Maid Marian, and
lived apart until they could be legally united. Perhaps this
tale has some connexion with the romance of the outlaw Fulk
Fitz Warin. Matilda or Mahaud, widow of Theobald Walter,
escaped from John&rsquo;s solicitations by marrying the outlawed Fulk
and following him to the forest. There were in semi-historical
legends three Matildas pursued by King John, of whom particulars
are given by H. L. D. Ward in his <i>Catalogue of Romances</i>
(i. 502). Their several histories were fused by the Elizabethan
dramatists, and associated with the Maid Marian of the morris
dance, who up to that time had probably only a vague connexion
with Robin Hood.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAIDSTONE,<a name="ar51" id="ar51"></a></span> a market town and municipal and parliamentary
borough, and the county town of Kent, England, 41 m. E.S.E. of
London by the South Eastern &amp; Chatham railway. Pop. (1901),
33,516; area, 4008 acres. It lies principally on the eastern
bank of the river Medway, the modern part spreading over the
western slopes of a picturesque valley, which is intersected and
environed by orchards and hop gardens, this being the richest
agricultural district of Kent. The hop grounds form the so-called
middle growth of Kent, and the town has the principal
grain market in the county. Archbishop Boniface in 1260
established a hospital here (Newark hospital) for poor pilgrims,
the chapel of which, with modern additions, is now St Peter&rsquo;s
Church. The parish church of St Mary, which had existed
from Norman times, was demolished in 1395 by Archbishop
Courtenay, who erected on the site the present church of All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page429" id="page429"></a>429</span>
Saints. This fine Perpendicular building contains, besides
many excellent monuments, the richly carved sedilia and the
twenty-eight oak seats used by the collegiate priests. Courtenay
also founded a college of secular canons, the ruins of which
are an interesting specimen of 14th-century architecture. From
the reign of John until the Reformation the archbishops had a
residence here, at which Stafford and Courtenay died. This
Perpendicular building, with its Elizabethan east front, was
acquired by the corporation as a memorial of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s
Jubilee in 1887, and houses the school of science and art. The
rectory, with the manor, passed into lay hands at the Reformation;
and, having been a perpetual curacy for three hundred
and twenty years, the living became a vicarage in 1866. The
grammar school was founded in 1549, and endowed with the
estates of the local Corpus Christi fraternity, then dissolved;
the hall in which the gild assembled remains, but the school is
established in modern buildings on a new site. There are
oil-mills, rope, sacking and twine factories, and cement, lime,
and brick works. There is a considerable carrying trade on
the Medway. A museum, with public library, was opened in
1858, in an interesting building of the early part of the 16th
century. This is the headquarters of the Kent Archaeological
Society, founded by the Rev. L. B. Larking in 1858. In 1890
an art gallery was added. The West Kent and General hospital,
the county ophthalmic hospital, county gaol and barracks may
be mentioned among other institutions. From Saxon times
down to 1830 condemned malefactors were executed, and all
the great county meetings were held, on Penenden Heath, a
common situated about a mile north-east of the town, and
enclosed by the corporation as a public recreation ground.
The parliamentary borough of Maidstone returns one member.
The town is governed by a mayor, 6 aldermen and 18
councillors.</p>

<p>There is evidence of a Roman settlement at Maidstone.
The name Maidstone (Medwegestun, Meddestane, Maydestan),
probably meaning Medway Town, is presumably of Saxon
origin. At the time of the Domesday Survey it belonged to the
archbishop of Canterbury, and from the reign of John the
archbishops had a residence there. Its position in the centre
of Kent gave it an early importance; the shire-moot was held
on Penenden Heath in the 11th century, and Maidstone was an
assize town in the reign of Edward I. In 1537 Cranmer exchanged
the manor of Maidstone with the king, and it was
granted by Edward VI. to Sir Thomas Wyatt. Edward also
incorporated the town by the title of the mayor, jurats and
commonalty; it had formerly been governed by a portreve
and 12 &ldquo;brethren.&rdquo; This charter was forfeited through
Wyatt&rsquo;s rebellion; a second charter was granted by Elizabeth
in 1559 and confirmed by subsequent sovereigns. A new
charter constituting a governing body of a mayor, 12 jurats
and 40 common councilmen was given at the petition of
the inhabitants by George II. in 1747, and remained the
governing charter until 1835. Four fairs were granted by
the charter of 1559; these are now held on the 13th of
February, the 12th of May, the 20th of June and the 17th
of October. A Thursday market was granted by Henry III.
to Archbishop Boniface, and a market every second Tuesday
in the month by charter of George II. A corn market on Tuesday
and a cattle market on Thursday are still held. The manufacture
of linen and woollen goods was introduced by Walloons,
who settled here in 1567. This was succeeded by paper-making,
now the chief industry of the town. The cultivation of hops
has been carried on since the 17th century.</p>

<p>Maidstone has been associated with various incidents of
general history. Wat Tyler broke into the prison, liberated
John Ball the rebel preacher, and committed various depredations.
Several of the leading inhabitants joined Jack Cade&rsquo;s
rising. The rising of the Kentish Royalists in 1648 collapsed at
Maidstone, where on the 1st of June Fairfax, after five hours&rsquo;
obstinate fighting, captured the town at midnight.</p>

O. Fr. <i>male</i>, mod. <i>malle</i>, a Teutonic word surviving in Dutch
<i>maal</i>), properly a bag, especially one used in travelling; this
word, which appears in Chaucer, is now applied chiefly to the
despatch and delivery of postal matter. In this sense &ldquo;mail&rdquo;
is properly the bag in which such matter is conveyed, and hence
is applied to the contents of the mail, postal matter collectively,
and to the train, carts, or other means used in the despatch
and delivery of the same. In general usage &ldquo;mail&rdquo; is confined
to the &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; as opposed to the &ldquo;inland&rdquo; despatch of
letters, &amp;c., and to which the word &ldquo;post&rdquo; is chiefly applied;
in official language, the word refers to the inland despatch. The
word appears also in &ldquo;mail-coach,&rdquo; a coach used for conveying
the mails, and in &ldquo;mail-cart,&rdquo; a cart similarly employed. This
word is also applied to a light low vehicle propelled or drawn
by hand, suitable for young children. The &ldquo;mail phaeton&rdquo;
is a type of phaeton with high seat for two persons and drawn
by a pair of horses.</p>

classical master in the Jesuit college at Rouen. He afterwards
devoted himself to preaching, but with only moderate success.
After having taken some part in minor controversies he threw
himself with energy into the dispute which had arisen as to the
Gallican liberties; for his <i>Traité historique sur les prérogatives
de l&rsquo;Église de Rome</i> (1682) he was by command of Innocent XI.
expelled from the Society, but rewarded by Louis XIV. with a
residence at the abbey of St Victor, Paris, and a pension. He

histories of Arianism, the iconoclastic controversy, the Greek
schism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and of the pontificates of

<p><span class="bold">MAIMING,<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> mutilation, a physical injury which involves
the loss of, or incapacity to use, a bodily member. The verb
&ldquo;to maim,&rdquo; in M. E. <i>maynhe</i>, <i>mahayme</i>, <i>mayme</i>, &amp;c. was adopted
from O. Fr. <i>mahaignier</i>: cf. It. <i>magagnars</i>, Med. Lat. <i>mahemiare</i>,
<i>mahennare</i>, &amp;c. (see Du Cange, <i>Gloss.</i>, <i>s.v.</i> &ldquo;Mahamium&rdquo;).
Maiming or mutilation is and has been practised by many
races with various ethnical and religious significances, and
was a customary form of punishment on the principle of an
&ldquo;eye for an eye&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mutilation</a></span>). In law &ldquo;maiming&rdquo;
is a criminal offence; the old law term for a special case of
maiming of persons was &ldquo;mayhem&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>), an Anglo-French
variant form of the word. Maiming of animals by others than
their owners is a particular form of the offences generally
grouped as &ldquo;malicious damage.&rdquo; For the purpose of the
law as to this offence animals are divided into cattle, which
includes horses, pigs and asses, and other animals which are
either subjects of larceny at common law or are usually kept
in confinement or for domestic purposes. The punishment
for maiming of cattle is three to fourteen years&rsquo; penal servitude.
Malicious injury to other animals is a misdemeanour punishable
on summary conviction. For a second offence the penalty is
imprisonment with hard labour for over twelve months.
(Malicious Damage Act 1861.) Maiming of animals by their
owner falls under the Cruelty to Animals Acts.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAIMON, SALOMON<a name="ar59" id="ar59"></a></span> (1754-1800), German philosopher,
was born of Jewish parentage in Polish Lithuania, and died
at Nieder-Siegersdorf on the 22nd of November 1800. He
married at the age of twelve, and studied medicine in Berlin.
In 1770 he severed his connexion with his orthodox co-religionists
by his critical commentary on the <i>Moreh Nebu&#7717;im</i> of Maimonides,
and devoted himself to the study of philosophy on the lines of
Wolff and Moses Mendelssohn. After many vicissitudes he
found a peaceful residence in the house of Count Kalkreuth at
Nieder-Siegersdorf in 1790. During the ensuing ten years
he published the works which have made his reputation as a
critical philosopher. Hitherto his life had been a long struggle
against difficulties of all kinds. From his autobiography,
it is clear that his keen critical faculty was developed in great
measure by the slender means of culture at his disposal. It
was not till 1788 that he made the acquaintance of the Kantian
philosophy, which was to form the basis of his lifework, and
as early as 1790 he published the <i>Versuch über die Transcendentalphilosophie</i>,
in which he formulates his objections to the system.
He seizes upon the fundamental incompatibility of a consciousness
which can apprehend, and yet is separated from, the
&ldquo;thing-in-itself.&rdquo; That which is object of thought cannot be
outside consciousness; just as in mathematics &radic;<span class="ov">&minus;1</span> is an unreal
quantity, so &ldquo;things-in-themselves&rdquo; are <i>ex hypothesi</i> outside
consciousness, <i>i.e.</i> are unthinkable. The Kantian paradox he
explains as the result of an attempt to explain the origin of
the &ldquo;given&rdquo; in consciousness. The <i>form</i> of things is admittedly
subjective; the mind endeavours to explain the <i>material</i> of the
given in the same terms, an attempt which is not only impossible
but involves a denial of the elementary laws of thought. Knowledge
of the given is, therefore, essentially incomplete. Complete
or perfect knowledge is confined to the domain of pure thought,
to logic and mathematics. Thus the problem of the &ldquo;thing-in-itself&rdquo;
is dismissed from the inquiry, and philosophy is limited
to the sphere of pure thought. The Kantian categories are,
indeed, demonstrable and true, but their application to the
given is meaningless and unthinkable. By this critical scepticism
Maimon takes up a position intermediate between Kant and
Hume. Hume&rsquo;s attitude to the empirical is entirely supported
by Maimon. The casual concept, as given by experience,
expresses not a necessary objective order of things, but an
ordered scheme of perception; it is subjective and cannot be
postulated as a concrete law apart from consciousness. The
main argument of the <i>Transcendentalphilosophie</i> not only drew
from Kant, who saw it in MS., the remark that Maimon alone
of his all critics had mastered the true meaning of his philosophy,
but also directed the path of most subsequent criticism.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAIMONIDES,<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> the common name of <span class="sc">Rabbi Moses ben
Maimon</span> (1135-1204), also known from the initials of these last
words as <span class="sc">Rambam</span>, Jewish philosopher. His life falls into
three epochs, which may be typified by the towns in which
they were passed, viz. Cordova, Fez and Cairo. He was born
in Cordova on the 20th of March 1135, the eve of Passover;
he had a brother, David, and one sister. His early years were
spent in his native town, which had then just passed the zenith
of its glory. The Arab rulers had fostered the development of
science, art, medicine, philosophy, literature and learning. All
these influences played their part in the education of Maimonides,
whose father, besides training him in all branches of
Hebrew and Jewish scholarship, implanted in the youth a sound
knowledge of these secular studies as well. In 1148 Cordova
was taken from the last Fatimite caliph by the victorious
Almohades, who had spread over Spain from N. Africa. These
militant revivalists strove to re-establish Islam in what they
considered its primitive simplicity. They laid great stress on
the unity of God, and tolerated neither schism within the faith
nor dissent without. The position of the orthodox Spanish
Jews became intolerable, and Maimon, after ten years of hardships,
wanderings and escapes, decided to take his family out
of the country. He settled in Fez. The years which Maimonides
spent there (1160-1165) were memorable for his friendship
with Abdul Arab Ibn Muisha&mdash;a Moslem poet and theologian&mdash;and
for the commencement of his literary activity. His energies
were diverted towards stimulating the religious feelings of his
brethren and combating assimilation. In consequence he became
alarmed for his own safety, and in 1165 left for Egypt, where
he settled after a passing visit to the Holy Land. Cordova
taught him the humanities; Fez humanity. Cairo, besides giving
him prominence at court and in the Jewish community, was
the centre of the almost world-wide influence which he exercised
over Jewry by his monumental writings and dominant personality.
By 1177 Maimonides was the recognized chief of the
Cairene congregation and consulted on important matters by
communities far and wide. Here he was joined by his most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page431" id="page431"></a>431</span>
famous disciple, Joseph Aknin. But his early life in Egypt
was fraught with deep sorrow. His father died soon after their
arrival, and Maimonides himself suffered severely from prostration
and sickness. His brother David, jointly with whom he carried
on a trade in gems, was shipwrecked in the Indian Ocean. With
him perished the entire fortune of the family. Forced to earn
a livelihood, Maimonides turned to medicine. The fame of
his skill eventually brought him the appointment of body
physician to Saladin, to whom, it is said, he was so attached
that when Richard I. wrote from Ascalon, offering him a similar
post at the English court, Maimonides refused. He married
the sister of Ibn al M&#257;li, one of the royal secretaries. In 1186,
his son Abraham was born. His remaining years were spent
in ceaseless activity and in controversy, which he sought to
avoid. He died amidst universal sorrow and veneration.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The works of Maimonides fall into three periods: (<i>a</i>) To the
Spanish period belong his commentary on the whole Talmud (not
fully carried out), a treatise on the calendar (<i>Maamar ha-ibbur</i>), a
treatise on logic (<i>Milloth Higgayon</i>), and his commentary on the
<i>Mishnah</i> (this was called <i>Siraj</i> or <i>Maor</i>, <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;Light&rdquo;: begun 1158,
completed 1168 in Egypt). (<i>b</i>) While he was in Fez, he wrote an
essay on the Sanctification of the Name of God (<i>Maamar Kiddush
Hashem</i>, <i>Iggereth Hashemad</i>). (<i>c</i>) The works written in Egypt were:
Letter to the Yemenites (<i>Iggereth Teman</i> or <i>Petha&#7717; Tiqvah</i>); <i>Responsa</i>
on questions of law; Biblical and Rabbinical Code (<i>Misnheh Torah</i>
or <i>Yad Hahazaka</i>, completed 1180); <i>Sepher hamitzvoth</i>, an abbreviated
handbook of the preceding; and his great philosophical
work <i>Moreh Nebu&#7717;im</i> or &ldquo;the guide of the perplexed&rdquo; (1190).
To these must be added certain portions of the <i>Mishnah</i> commentary,
such as the &ldquo;Eight Chapters,&rdquo; the discussion on reward and punishment
and immortality, the Jewish Creed, which have acquired fame
as independent works.</p>
</div>

<p>The influence of Moses ben Maimon is incalculable. &ldquo;From
Moses unto Moses there arose not one like Moses,&rdquo; is the verdict
of posterity. Maimonides was the great exponent of reason
in faith and toleration in theology. One of the main services
to European thought of the &ldquo;Guide&rdquo; was its independent
criticism of some of Aristotle&rsquo;s principles. His codification of
the Talmud was equally appreciated in the study of the scholar
and in practical life. Christian Europe owed much to Maimonides.
Not only did his &ldquo;Guide&rdquo; influence scholasticism in
general, but it was from his Code that the Church derived its
medieval knowledge of the Synagogue.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A complete bibliography will be found in <i>Maimonides</i>, by David
Yellin and Israel Abrahams (London, 1903); the final chapter of
that work gives a summary of the influence of Maimonides on
Christian philosophers such as Aquinas, and Jewish such as Spinoza.
The &ldquo;Guide&rdquo; has been translated into English by M. Friedlander
(1881-1885; new ed., 1905). See also <i>Jewish Encyclopedia</i>, articles

<p><span class="bold">MAIN<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> (Lat. <i>Moenus</i>), a river of Germany, and the most
important right-bank tributary of the Rhine. It has two
sources, the Weisse Main (White Main), which rises in the
Fichtelgebirge on the east side of the Ochsenkopf, and the Rote
Main (Red Main), which, rising on the eastern slope of the
Frankish Jura, flows past Bayreuth. They unite 3 m. below
Kulmbach, 920 ft. above the sea. Hence the river, already
of considerable size, pursues a north-westerly direction, skirting
the spurs of the Frankish Jura in a pleasant valley. At Lichtenfels
the river takes a south-westerly course, which it retains
until entering the fertile basin of Bamberg. Here it receives
from the south-east the waters of its chief tributary, the Regnitz,
and enters upon its middle course. Its direction is now again
north-west, and meandering through pleasant vales and pastures
it passes Hassfurt and reaches Schweinfurt. Its course is
now almost due south to Ochsenfurt, when it again proceeds
north-west. Continuing in this direction amid vine-clad hills,
it washes the walls of the university city of Würzburg, and
thence, dividing the forest-clad ranges of the Spessart and
the Odenwald, reaches Gemünden. Here it is joined from
the right by the Frankish Saale and, turning abruptly south,
receives at Wertheim the beautiful Tauber. Feudal castles
and medieval towns now crown its banks, notably, Freudenberg
and Miltenberg. From the latter it proceeds due north to
Aschaffenburg, whence passing Frankfort it pours its yellow
waters into the green waters of the Rhine just above Mainz.
The Main has a total length of 310 m. and drains a basin of
approximately 11,000 sq. m. It is navigable from the confluence
of the Regnitz, 240 m. from its mouth, for barges and
other small craft, and through the Ludwig Canal is connected
with the Danube.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAIN<a name="ar62" id="ar62"></a></span> (from the Aryan root which appears in &ldquo;may&rdquo; and
&ldquo;might,&rdquo; and Lat. <i>magnus</i>, great), a word meaning properly
power or strength, especially physical. This use chiefly survives
in the expression &ldquo;with might and main.&rdquo; The word is more
common as a substantival elliptical use of the adjective, which
usually has the sense of principal or chief in size, strength,
importance, &amp;c. Thus &ldquo;the main,&rdquo; the high open sea, is
for &ldquo;main sea,&rdquo; cf. &ldquo;mainland,&rdquo; the principal part of a territory
excluding islands and sometimes far-projecting peninsulas.
The expression &ldquo;the Spanish main&rdquo; properly meant
that part of the main land of the N.E. coast of South America
stretching from the Orinoco to the Isthmus of Panama, and
the former Spanish possessions in Central America bordering
on the Caribbean Sea, but it is often loosely used, especially
in connexion with the buccaneers, of the Caribbean Sea itself.
The term &ldquo;main&rdquo; is also thus used of a principal pipe or cable
for conducting gas, water, electricity, &amp;c. The elliptical
use does not appear, however, in such expressions as main
road, line, stream. Another use of the word &ldquo;main&rdquo; has
a somewhat obscure history. It appears as a term in the game
of hazard, and also in cock-fighting. In the last it is used for
a match, and for the cocks engaged in a match. In hazard
it is the number called by the &ldquo;caster&rdquo; before the dice are
thrown; this may be any number from five to nine inclusive.
The usual derivation is from the French <i>main</i>, a hand, but
according to the <i>New English Dictionary</i> there is no evidence
for this, and the more probable explanation is that it is an
adaptation of &ldquo;main&rdquo; meaning principal or chief. From
this use of the word in hazard the expression &ldquo;main chance&rdquo;
is derived. &ldquo;Main,&rdquo; a shortened form of domain or demesne,
only now survives in Scotland, usually in the plural &ldquo;mains&rdquo;
for a home farm.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAINA<a name="ar63" id="ar63"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Mani</span>) and <span class="bold">MAINOTES,</span> a district and people
of the Peloponnesus, the modern Morea. Maina is the country
occupied by the mountain range of Taygetus from Sparta to
Cape Matapan, the ancient Taenarum. It is now divided
between the modern districts Oetylos and Gythion. Before
the organization of the present kingdom of Greece, Maina
was subdivided into <span class="grk" title="Exô Manê">&#917;&#958;&#969; &#924;&#940;&#957;&#951;</span>, Outer Maina, from the frontier
of Kalamata, on the Gulf of Messenia, to Vitylo (Oetylos)
and inland to the summit of Taygetus; <span class="grk" title="Katô Manê">&#922;&#940;&#964;&#969; &#924;&#940;&#957;&#951;</span>, Lower Maina,
from Vitylo to Cape Matapan; and <span class="grk" title="Mesa Manê">&#924;&#941;&#963;&#945; &#924;&#940;&#957;&#951;</span>, or Inner Maina,
on the east, and on the Gulf of Laconia as far as the plain of
Elos. It contained over a hundred villages. The country
is mountainous and inaccessible, a formation to which it owes
its historical importance. The Mainotes claim to descend
from the Spartans, and probably represent the Eleuthero,
or free, Laconians who were delivered by Rome from the power
of Sparta, as is suggested by the traces of ancient Greek in
their dialect and by their physical type. Their country being
a natural fortress, they were able to defend themselves against
the Byzantine emperors, the barbarians who broke into the
empire, the Latin princes of Achaea of the house of Villehardouin,
and the Turks. As their country is also poor and maritime,
they were early tempted to take to piratical adventure. Gibbon
says that &ldquo;in the time of Constantine Porphyrogenitus they
had acquired the name of Mainotes, under which they dishonour
the claim of liberty by the inhuman pillage of all that
is shipwrecked on their rocky shore.&rdquo; Their neighbours gave
their country the name of &ldquo;Kakaboulia&rdquo;&mdash;the land of wicked
counsels. The passes of their mountains were elaborately
fortified and their villages were full of fortified towers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page432" id="page432"></a>432</span>
(<i>pyrgoi</i>) from which they formed their own favourite
epithet, Maina Polypyrgos&mdash;many-towered Maina. On the
western side it also contains the remains of feudal
keeps, erected by William II. de Villehardouin (1245-1278)
and other Latin princes of Achaea. The Mainotes did not
become Christians till the 9th century. From the 15th till
the 17th century they recognized a family which claimed to
belong to the Comneni of Trebizond as head chiefs. But the
real power was in the hands of the chiefs of the different families
and villages, who formed a turbulent and martial aristocracy.
Enduring and ferocious feuds were common among them.
In the course of the 18th century the family of Mavromicheli
(Black Michael), which belonged to lower Maina, established
a general headship over the Mainotes after much strife and
many murders. When Russia endeavoured to promote a
rising against the Turks in the Morea in 1770 the Mainotes
acted with her, and the strength of their country enabled them
to escape the vengeance of the Turks when the Christians
were cynically deserted by the Russians. In 1777 their practical
independence was recognized by the sultan&rsquo;s officers.
During the Greek war of independence the Mainotes were
chiefly led by Petros (Petro Bey) Mavromicheli, known to
his countrymen as the king of Maina, who undoubtedly cherished
the hope of establishing a principality for himself. The
freedom of Greece, for which he had fought in his own way,
proved the ruin of his ambition. He found the new order
less compatible with his schemes than the Turkish dominion.
Petro Bey was imprisoned by the Greek president Capodistrias
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Capo d&rsquo;Istria, Count</a></span>.), who was in revenge murdered
by the Mavromichelis. The family were finally content to
become courtiers and officials in the reign of King Otto I.
In the 19th century Maina was but little affected by civilization,
except in so far as the efficiency of modern navies debarred
the Mainotes from their old resource of piracy.</p>

du</span> (1676-1753), daughter of Henri Jules de Bourbon,
prince de Condé and Anne of Bavaria, was born on the 8th of
November 1676. On the 19th of March 1692 she married
Louis Auguste de Bourbon, duc du Maine, son of Louis XIV.
and Mme de Montespan. The duchesse du Maine held a little
court at Sceaux, where she gave brilliant entertainments
and immersed herself in political intrigues. Displeased with
the action of the regent Orleans in degrading the illegitimate
children of Louis XIV. from their precedence above the peers
of France, she induced her husband to join in the Cellamare
conspiracy for the transference of the regency to the king of
Spain. The plot, however, was discovered, and she was imprisoned
in 1719. The following year she returned to Sceaux,
where she resumed her salon and gathered round her a brilliant
company of wits and poets. She died in Paris on the 23rd
of January 1753.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAINE, SIR HENRY JAMES SUMNER<a name="ar65" id="ar65"></a></span> (1822-1888), English
comparative jurist and historian, son of Dr James Maine,
of Kelso, Roxburghshire, was born on the 15th of August 1822.
He was at school at Christ&rsquo;s Hospital, and thence went up
to Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1840. At Cambridge
he was one of the most brilliant classical scholars of his time.
He won a Craven scholarship and graduated as senior classic
in 1844, being also senior chancellor&rsquo;s medallist in classics.
Shortly afterwards he accepted a tutorship at Trinity Hall.
In 1847 he was appointed regius professor of civil law, and he
was called to the bar three years later; he held this chair till
1854. Even the rudiments of Roman law were not then included
in the ordinary training of English lawyers; it was
assumed at the universities that any good Latin scholar could
qualify himself at short notice for keeping up such tradition
of civilian studies as survived. Maine cannot have known
much Roman law in 1847, but in 1856 he contributed to the
<i>Cambridge Essays</i> the essay on Roman law and legal education,
republished in the later editions of <i>Village Communities</i>, which
was the first characteristic evidence of his genius. Meanwhile
he had become one of the readers appointed by the Inns of Court,
in the first of their many half-hearted attempts at legal education,
in 1852. Lectures delivered by Maine in this capacity
were the groundwork of <i>Ancient Law</i> (1861), the book by
which his reputation was made at one stroke. Its object,
as modestly stated in the preface, was &ldquo;to indicate some of
the earliest ideas of mankind, as they are reflected in ancient
law, and to point out the relation of those ideas to modern
thought.&rdquo; Within a year of its publication the post of legal
member of council in India was offered to Maine, then a junior
member of the bar with little practice, few advantages of connexion,
and no political or official claims. He declined once,
on grounds of health; the very next year the office was again
vacant. This time Maine was persuaded to accept, not that
his health had improved, but that he thought India might
not make it much worse. It turned out that India suited
him much better than Cambridge or London. His work,
like most of the work done by Englishmen in India in time
of peace, was not of a showy kind&mdash;its value is shown by the
fact that he was asked to prolong his services beyond the
regular term of five years, and returned to England only in
1869. The subjects on which it was his duty to advise the
government of India were as much political as legal. They
ranged from such problems as the land settlement of the Punjab,
or the introduction of civil marriage to provide for the needs
of unorthodox Hindus, to the question how far the study of
Persian should be required or encouraged among European
civil servants. On the civil marriage question in particular,
and some years earlier on the still more troublesome one of
allowing the remarriage of native converts to Christianity,
his guidance, being not only learned but statesmanlike, was
of the greatest value. Plans of codification, moreover, were
prepared, and largely shaped, under Maine&rsquo;s direction, which
were carried into effect by his successors, Sir J. Fitzjames
Stephen and Dr Whitley Stokes. The results are open to
criticism in details, but form on the whole a remarkable achievement
in the conversion of unwritten and highly technical
law into a body of written law sufficiently clear to be administered
by officers to many of whom its ideas and language are
foreign. All this was in addition to the routine of legislative
and consulting work and the establishment of the legislative
department of the government of India on substantially its
present footing.</p>

<p>Maine&rsquo;s power of swiftly assimilating new ideas and appreciating
modes of thought and conduct remote from modern
Western life came into contact with the facts of Indian society
at exactly the right time, and his colleagues and other competent
observers expressed the highest opinion of his work. In return
Maine brought back from his Indian office a store of knowledge
which enriched all his later writings, though he took India
by name for his theme only once. This essay on India was
his contribution to the composite work entitled <i>The Reign of
Queen Victoria</i> (ed. T. H. Ward, 1887). Not having been
separately published, it is perhaps the least known of Maine&rsquo;s
writings; but its combination of just perception and large
grasp with command of detail is not easily matched outside
W. Stubbs&rsquo;s prefaces to some of the chronicles in the Rolls
series, and (more lately) F. W. Maitland&rsquo;s monographs. As
vice-chancellor of the university of Calcutta, Maine commented,
with his usual pregnant ingenuity, on the results produced
by the contact of Eastern and Western thought. Three
of these addresses were published, wholly or in part, in the
later editions of <i>Village Communities</i>; the substance of others
is understood to be embodied in the Cambridge Rede lecture
of 1875, which is to be found in the same volume. The practical
side of Maine&rsquo;s experience was not long lost to India; he
became a member of the secretary of state&rsquo;s council in 1871,
and remained so for the rest of his life. In the same year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page433" id="page433"></a>433</span>
he was gazetted a K.C.S.I. In 1869 Maine was appointed
to the chair of historical and comparative jurisprudence newly
founded in the university of Oxford by Corpus Christi College.
Residence at Oxford was not required, and the election amounted
to an invitation to the new professor to resume and continue
in his own way the work he had begun in <i>Ancient Law</i>. During
the succeeding years he published the principal matters of
his lectures in a carefully revised literary form: <i>Village Communities
in the East and the West</i> (1871); <i>Early History of Institutions</i>
(1875); <i>Early Law and Custom</i> (1883). In all these works
the phenomena of societies in an archaic stage, whether still
capable of observation or surviving in a fragmentary manner
among more modern surroundings or preserved in contemporary
records, are brought into line, often with singular felicity,
to establish and illustrate the normal process of development
in legal and political ideas.</p>

<p>In 1877 the mastership of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where
Maine had formerly been tutor, became vacant. There were
two strong candidates whose claims were so nearly equal that
it was difficult to elect either; the difficulty was solved by a
unanimous invitation to Maine to accept the post. His acceptance
entailed the resignation of the Oxford chair, though not
continuous residence at Cambridge. Ten years later considerations
of a somewhat similar kind led to his election to
succeed Sir William Harcourt as Whewell professor of international
law at Cambridge. His all too short performance in
this office is represented by a posthumous volume which had not
received his own final revision, <i>International Law</i> (1888).</p>

<p>Meanwhile Maine had published in 1885 his one work of
speculative politics, a volume of essays on <i>Popular Government</i>,
designed to show that democracy is not in itself more stable
than any other form of government, and that there is no necessary
connexion between democracy and progress. The book
was deliberately unpopular in tone; it excited much controversial
comment and some serious and useful discussion.</p>

<p>In 1886 there appeared in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> (clxii. 181)
an article on the posthumous work of J. F. M&rsquo;Lennan, edited
and completed by his brother, entitled &ldquo;The Patriarchal
Theory.&rdquo; The article, though necessarily unsigned (in accordance
with the rule of the <i>Quarterly</i> as it then stood), was Maine&rsquo;s
reply to the M&lsquo;Lennan brothers&rsquo; attack on the historical reconstruction
of the Indo-European family system put forward
in <i>Ancient Law</i> and supplemented in <i>Early Law and Custom</i>.
Maine was generally averse from controversy, but showed
on this occasion that it was not for want of controversial power.
He carried the war back into the invader&rsquo;s country, and charged
J. F. M&lsquo;Lennan&rsquo;s theory of primitive society with owing its
plausible appearance of universal validity to general neglect
of the Indo-European evidence and misapprehension of such
portions of it as M&lsquo;Lennan did attempt to handle.</p>

<p>Maine&rsquo;s health, which had never been strong, gave way
towards the end of 1887. He went to the Riviera under medical
advice, and died at Cannes on the 3rd of February 1888. He
left a wife and two sons, of whom the elder died soon afterwards.</p>

<p>An excellent summary of Maine&rsquo;s principal writings may
be seen in Sir Mountstuart Grant Duff&rsquo;s memoir. The prompt
and full recognition of Maine&rsquo;s genius by continental publicists
must not pass unmentioned even in the briefest notice. France,
Germany, Italy, Russia have all contributed to do him honour;
this is the more remarkable as one or two English publicists
of an older school signally failed to appreciate him. Maine
warned his countrymen against the insularity which results
from ignorance of all law and institutions save one&rsquo;s own;
his example has shown the benefit of the contrary habit. His
prominent use of Roman law and the wide range of his observation
have made his works as intelligible abroad as at home,
and thereby much valuable information&mdash;for example, concerning
the nature of British supremacy in India, and the position
of native institutions there&mdash;has been made the property of
the world of letters instead of the peculiar and obscure possession
of a limited class of British public servants. Foreign
readers of Maine have perhaps understood even better than
English ones that he is not the propounder of a system but
the pioneer of a method, and that detailed criticism, profitable
as it may be and necessary as in time it must be, will not leave
the method itself less valid or diminish the worth of the master&rsquo;s
lessons in its use. The rather small bulk of Maine&rsquo;s published
and avowed work may be explained partly by a fine literary
sense which would let nothing go out under his name unfinished,
partly by the drawbacks incident to precarious health. Maine&rsquo;s
temperament was averse from the labour of minute criticism,
and his avoidance of it was no less a matter of prudence. But
it has to be remembered that Maine also wrote much which
was never publicly acknowledged. Before he went to India
he was one of the original contributors to the <i>Saturday Review</i>,
founded in 1855, and the inventor of its name. Like his intimate
friend Fitzjames Stephen, he was an accomplished journalist,
enjoyed occasional article-writing as a diversion from
official duties, and never quite abandoned it. The practice
of such writing probably counted for something in the freedom
and clearness of Maine&rsquo;s style and the effectiveness of his
dialectic. His books are a model of scientific exposition which
never ceases to be literature.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAINE,<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span> an old French province, bounded N. by Normandy,
E. by Orléanais, S. by Touraine and Anjou, and W. by Brittany.
Before the Roman Conquest the region occupied by this province
was inhabited by the Aulerci Cenomanni and the Aulerci
Diablintes; under the Roman empire it consisted of two <i>civitates</i>
comprised in the Provincia Lugdunensis Tertia&mdash;the Civitas
Cenomannorum and the Civitas Diablintum, whose chief towns
were Le Mans and Jublains. These two <i>civitates</i> were united
during the barbarian period and formed a single bishopric,
that of Le Mans, suffragan to the metropolitan see of Tours.
Under the Merovingians and Carolingians the diocese of Le
Mans corresponded to the Pagus Cenomanensis, and in the
feudal period to the county of Maine. In the 16th century
the county of Maine, with the addition of Perche, formed
a military government&mdash;the province of Maine. Since 1790
this province has been represented approximately by the
departments of Sarthe and Mayenne, the respective capitals
of which are Le Mans and Laval. In 1855 the bishopric of
Laval was separated from that of Le Mans. Maine was evangelized
in the 3rd century by St Julian. After forming part of
the kingdom of Syagrius, it was conquered by Clovis at the
end of the 5th century. Owing to the scarcity of documents
the history of Maine until the end of the 9th century is merged
in the history of the bishops of Le Mans, which has come down
to us in the <i>Actus pontificum Cenomannis in urbe degentium</i>
(ed. Busson-Ledru, Le Mans, 1901), composed under the direction
of Bishop Aldric (832-857). Roger (<i>c.</i> 892-<i>c.</i> 898) was
perhaps the first hereditary count of Maine; the counts whose
existence is certain are Hugh I. (<i>c.</i> 939-before 992), Hugh II.
(before 992-1015), Herbert I. (1015-1032 to 1036), Hugh III.
(1032 to 1036-1051), Herbert II. (1051-1062), William the Bastard (1063-1087), Robert Curthose (1087-1091), Hugh IV.
(1091-1092) and Helias (1092-1110). Maine, which was
in the vassalage of Anjou as early as the 9th century, was
united to Anjou in 1110 by the marriage of Count Helias&rsquo;s
daughter to Fulk V., count of Anjou, and passed to the English
crown in 1154, when Henry Plantagenet (who was born at
Le Mans) became king of England. In 1204, after the confiscation
of the estates of John of England, Maine was united
to France; in 1246 it was separated from France by Louis IX.,
who handed it over to his brother Charles, count of Provence.
Again united to France in 1328, it was given in 1356 as an
apanage to Louis, second son of King John II., and did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page434" id="page434"></a>434</span>
definitely return to the French crown until 1481, after the
death of Charles II., count of Maine. During the Hundred
Years&rsquo; War Maine was taken in 1425 by the English, who lost
it in 1448.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAINE,<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> a North Atlantic state of the United States of
America, the most north-easterly state in the Union, and the
largest of the New England group. It lies between 43° 4&prime; and
47° 27&prime; 33&Prime; N., and between 66° 56&prime; 48&Prime; and 71° 6&prime; 41&Prime; W. It
is bounded N.W. by the Canadian province of Quebec; N.
and E. by the Canadian province of New Brunswick, from
which it is separated in part by the natural barriers of the
Saint John River, the Grand (or Schoodic) Lakes, the Saint
Croix River, and Passamaquoddy Bay; S.S.E. by the Atlantic
Ocean; and W. by New Hampshire, the Piscataqua and Salmon
Falls rivers being the natural boundary lines at the S.W. The
area of the state is 33,040 sq. m., 3145 sq. m. being water
surface.</p>

<p>Maine attracts more summer visitors than any other state
in the Union. This is due to the cool and refreshing summer
climate; the picturesque coast and its many islands, which are
favourite grounds for camps and summer cottages; the mountains,
and the beautiful lakes and rivers, many of which afford
opportunities for good fishing and canoeing. Among the more
widely known resorts are Mount Desert Island, on which is
Bar Harbor, a fashionable summer place of great beauty;
Long Island, Orr&rsquo;s and other islands in Casco Bay; Old Orchard,
with a gently sloping white sand sea-beach 9 m. long, Rangeley
and Moosehead Lakes, favourite resorts of fishermen and hunters;
Mt Katahdin, in the heart of the moose country; and Poland
Springs (38 m. by rail from Portland) in Androscoggin county,
near lake Anasigunticook. About 1870, camps, summer cottages,
summer hotels and boarding houses began to multiply
throughout the state. The needs of this summer population
gave a new impulse and a new turn to agriculture; and the
demand for souvenirs revived among the Indians basket-weaving,
moccasin-making, and such crafts.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Physical Features.</i>&mdash;The surface is a gently rolling upland, forming
a part of the &ldquo;New England uplands,&rdquo; above which rise isolated
mountain peaks and clusters of peaks, and below which are cut
numerous river valleys.<a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The highest peak is Mt Katahdin (5200
ft.), a little N.E. of the centre of the state in Piscataquis county,
which rises from a comparatively level upland. South-west of
Katahdin, in Franklin county, are most of the other high peaks
of the state: Saddleback Mountain (4000 ft.), Mt Abraham (3388
ft.), Mt Bigelow (3600 ft.), and Mt Blue (3200 ft.). A little N.
of this line of mountain peaks is the water-parting which divides
the state into a north slope and a south slope. The north slope
descends gently both to the N. and to the E.; although quite hilly
in the middle and western portions it is so poorly drained that
swamps abound in all sections. The south slope which contains
nearly all the mountains and is generally more hilly, has a mean
descent toward the sea of about 7 ft. to the mile, the fall being
greater in the W., where the mountains are high at the N. and the
shore low at the S., and less to the E., where the water-parting is
lower and the shore high and rocky.</p>

<p>After the uplift which caused the rivers to cut below the general
&ldquo;uplands,&rdquo; and develop well marked valleys for themselves, came
the period of the great continental glaciation. The glacier or ice
sheet overran all Maine, irregularly scouring out the bed rock to
produce rock basins, damming up many river valleys with glacial
deposits and completely disarranging the drainage lines. When the
ice melted, the rock basins and the dammed-up valleys filled with
water to produce lakes. This is the origin of the numerous lakes of
Maine, which give it some of its most beautiful scenery, and help to
make it a holiday resort in summer. These lakes are about 1600 in
number, are scattered in all parts of the state, are especially numerous
at high elevations, and have an aggregate area of more than
2000 sq. m. Few other regions have so many large lakes so variously
situated, and with such beauty of aspect and surroundings. They
contribute largely to a constant supply of water power for which
the course of the rivers of S.W. Maine are exceptionally well adapted,
many of them abound in trout, salmon, togue, black bass and
pickerel; and near them there is still much game. Moosehead
Lake (about 120 sq. m.; 35 m. long and from 2 m. to 10 m. wide),
on the boundary between Piscataquis and Somerset counties, is
the largest in Maine and the largest inland body of water wholly
in New England; the Kennebec River is its principal outlet and
Mt Kineo rises abruptly to about 1760 ft. above the sea (about
700 ft. above the lake) on its eastern shore. Other lakes, such as
the Rangeley Lakes,<a name="fa2h" id="fa2h" href="#ft2h"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Chesuncook and Twin Lakes on the Penobscot,
and the Grand or Schoodic Lakes, in the western boundary at the
head waters of the Saint Croix River, equal or surpass Moosehead in
picturesqueness. The glacier or ice sheet, above referred to, deposited
till or boulder clay, which was compacted under the enormous
pressure of the ice sheet to form the &ldquo;hard-pan&rdquo; referred to later.
The glaciation is also responsible for the poor soil of most of the state,
for, although the rocks are the same crystallines which give good
soils further south in unglaciated regions, all the decayed portions
of the Maine rocks have been removed by glacial erosion, revealing
fresh, barren rock over great areas, or depositing the rather sterile
hard-pan as a thin coating in other places.</p>

<p>After the uplift came a period of subsidence, during which this
region sank one or more thousand feet, allowing the sea to encroach
on the land and run far inland into the previously made river
valleys. This depression probably occurred during the glacial
period, perhaps toward its close, and is responsible for the second
most important feature of Maine physiography, the embayed coast.
To this subsidence are due the picturesque coastal scenery, the
numerous islands and bays, the good harbours and the peculiar
coast-line.</p>

<p>The shortest distance between the N.E. and the S.W. extremities
of the coast is only 225 m.; but, on account of projections and
indentations, the coast-line measures not less than 2500 m. The
headlands, the deep indentations and the numerous islands in the
bays and beyond produce a beautiful mingling of land and sea and
give to the whole ocean front the appearance of a fringed and
tasselled border; west of the mouth of the Kennebec River are a
marshy shore and many low grassy islands; but east of this river
the shore becomes more and more bold, rising in the precipitous
cliffs and rounded summits of Mt Desert and Quoddy Head, 1527
and 1000 ft. high respectively. All along the coast-line there
are capacious and well-protected harbours, Casco, Penobscot,
Frenchman&rsquo;s, Machias and Passamaquoddy bays being especially
noteworthy.</p>

<p>After the subsidence came another period of uplift, possibly still
in progress. This uplift has brought up submarine deposits of
sand, &amp;c., to form little coastal plains at some points along the
coast, providing good land for settlement and clay for brick and
pottery. Further evidence of this uplift is found in old beach lines
now well above sea-level.</p>

<p>The principal river systems of Maine are the Saint John on the
north slope, and the Penobscot, the Kennebec, the Androscoggin,
and the Saco on the south slope. The mean height of the basin
of the St John is exceeded only by that of the Androscoggin, but
the fall of the St John River through the greater part of its course in
Maine is only sufficient to give a sluggish or a gentle current. The
Penobscot, Kennebec, Androscoggin and Saco have numerous falls
and rapids.</p>

<p><i>Fauna.</i>&mdash;The animal life of Maine shows a mixture of northern
and southern forms, and very little that is peculiar as compared with
surrounding regions. The state has moose, caribou and deer,
especially in the northern part. The black bear, wolf, catamount,
wolverine, wild cat, fox, beaver, racoon, marten, sable, woodchuck,
skunk, otter, mink, rabbit and squirrel are also found. Geese, ducks
and other water fowl frequent the lakes and bays in the migratory
season, and eagles, gulls, hawks, kingfishers, owls, plover, woodcock,
&ldquo;partridge&rdquo; (ruffed grouse), robins, orioles, bobolinks, blue birds,
swallows, sparrows, and many other insectivorous birds are common.
In the inland waters salmon, trout, togue (<i>Salvelinus namaycush</i>),
pickerel and bass abound; along the shore there are lobsters,
clams and scallops (<i>Pecten irradians</i>); and off the shore are herring,
alewives, mackerel, cod, halibut, haddock, smelts, hake, menhaden,
porgies and porpoises. The game in the North Woods attracts large
numbers of sportsmen during the autumn season.</p>

<p class="pt2"><i>Flora.</i>&mdash;Maine was formerly covered with forests, principally of
white pine and spruce, but mixed with these were some hemlock,
tamarack, cedar, and, on the south slope, birch, poplar, oak, maple
and beech. Chestnut and walnut are rare and are found only near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page435" id="page435"></a>435</span>
the south-west border. In 1900 about 21% of the state&rsquo;s area was
cleared, and much besides had once been cleared, but not being
suited to agriculture had become reforested. Of fruit trees the chief
is the apple. The plum, cherry and pear also thrive. The peach
grows well only in the south-west near the border. Species of grape,
gooseberry and currant are native, and others are cultivated with
advantage. The blackberry, raspberry, blueberry and strawberry
grow wild in profusion throughout the state.</p>

<p><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;The climate of the state is moist and, for its latitude,
cold. Extremes of temperature are not so great as farther inland
in the same latitude; for the summer heats are tempered by the
sea and the cool north winds, and the winter cold is so constant as
to be less severely felt than the changing temperature of more
southern districts. The summers are short, there being only about
4½ months between frosts even in the southern sections, and the mean
summer temperature is about 62° F. The mean winter temperature
is approximately 20° F., and the mean annual temperature for the
entire state is 42° F., that for the north slope being about 5° F. less
than that for the south slope. Although the temperature remains
pretty steadily below the freezing point for at least three months of
the year, many of the harbours remain unobstructed; for the tides
and the prevailing off-shore winds break up and drive off the ice.
The precipitation is about 42 in. annually, and is distributed very
evenly throughout the year, 10-11 in. of rain or its equivalent in
snow falling each season. During 4½ months about 44% of the
precipitation is in the form of snow; but the snow-fall varies
from about 60 in. on the coast to more than 100 in. on the north
slope. The winds are variable; at no season of the year is it usual
for them to blow from the same direction for many days in succession.
But, with the exception of those from the west, they are maritime and
consequently moisture-bearing. In summer, especially in the latter
part of it, the cool and moist N. or N.E. winds often cause a considerable
part of the state to be enveloped in fog for several days in
succession.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture.</i>&mdash;The soil is for the most part glacial drift, containing
a large mixture of clay with sand or gravel, and the subsoil is mostly
&ldquo;hard-pan,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> mingled clay and boulders which have been so
much compressed by glacial action as to make the mixture hard and
ledge-like. Except in the valley of the Aroostook and along the
Kennebec, the Penobscot, and some other rivers, the soil is generally
unfit for cultivation, there being too little alluvium mixed with it
to make it fertile. In the Aroostook valley, however, is the largest
undivided area of good arable land in all New England, the soil being
a deep, porous, yellow loam well adapted to the growth of cereals
and to market gardening. The most sterile regions are on the
mountains and along the coast. Because of the cold climate, the
large areas in which there is little or no good arable land, the growing
demand for timber land, and the large and constant supply of water-power
afforded by the principal rivers, agriculture in Maine, as in
all the other New England states except Vermont, is a smaller
industry than manufacturing; in 1900 there were 87,932 people
engaged in manufacturing and only 76,932 engaged in agriculture.
Only 32.9% of the state&rsquo;s land area was in that year included
in farms, only 37.9% of this farm land was improved, and
only 16.3% of the improved land was in crops other than
hay and forage. Nevertheless, as indicated by the unusually large
proportion of farmers who either own their farms or pay cash rent
for them, farming usually is profitable. The number of farms in
1900 was 59,299; of these 18,644 contained between 50 and 100
acres and 17,191 contained between 100 and 175 acres, the average
size being 106.2 acres; 54,263 (or 91.5%) were operated by
their owners, 775 were operated by part owners, 2030 by cash
tenants, and only 745 by share tenants. Beginning with the middle
of the 19th century, the increasing competition of the more productive
soils of the West, the growth of urban population in the
state, and the number of summer visitors effected the reforesting
of much poor land and the more intensive cultivation of the better
arable land. The cultivation of cereals, for example, has given way
to a marked extent in nearly all the farming districts except in
Aroostook county to market gardening, dairying, and egg and
poultry production. The number of dairy cows increased from
157,240 in 1890 to 183,000 in 1908, and the annual production of
milk increased from 57,969,791 gallons in 1890 to 99,586,188 gallons
in 1900. The number of other neat cattle (180,878 in 1900; 151,000
in 1908) decreased during every decade from 1860 to 1900; the
number of sheep in 1900 was 427,209 (31.9% less than in 1890),
and in 1908 it was 267,000; but the number of horses in 1890
and 1900 was about the same (140,310 in 1960, but only 116,000
in 1908). Hay is still by far the largest crop, the acreage of it and
of forage in 1899 being 1,270,254 acres, or 76.5% of that of
all crops, and the yield was 1,133,932 tons; in 1907 the acreage
was 1,400,000 acres, and the crop was 2,100,000 tons. The acreage
of cereals decreased from 187,013 in 1880, when agriculture in
Aroostook county was little developed, to 166,896 in 1899, when
the cereal acreage in Aroostook county alone was 82,069. Maine
potatoes are of a superior quality, and the acreage of this crop
increased from 49,617 in 1889 to 118,000 in 1907. Sweet Indian
corn, cabbages, turnips, cucumbers and tomatoes are grown in
large quantities. The fruit crop consists very largely of
apples and strawberries (1,421,773 bushels of apples and 1,066,860
quarts of strawberries in 1899). The output of eggs increased from
9,369,534 dozen in 1889 to 13,304,150 dozen in 1899. The most
productive dairy section of the state is a belt extending from the
south-west corner N.E. entirely across the state and embracing
the whole or parts of the counties of York, Oxford, Cumberland,
Androscoggin, Kennebec, Penobscot and Aroostook.</p>

<p><i>Lumber Industry.</i>&mdash;Except in the remote parts, the valuable white
pine, for which Maine was long noted, has been cut; but the woodland
of the state was estimated in 1900 at 23,700 sq. m. or 79%
of its area. The tendency is for this area to increase, for the
establishment between 1890 and 1900 of large paper and pulp
mills on some of the principal rivers of the south slope greatly
increased the value of forests, especially those of spruce and poplar.
The state makes large appropriations for preventing and extinguishing
forest fires, and in 1903 established a department of forestry in
the university of Maine. Good spruce, which is by far the most
valuable timber in the state and is used most largely for the manufacture
of paper and pulp, stands in large quantities in the St John,
Penobscot, Androscoggin and Kennebec basins. Poplar, also used
for the manufacture of paper, abounds in several sections of the
south slope, but is most abundant in the basin of the Kennebec.
White birch, used largely for the manufacture of spools, is found
throughout a wide belt extending across the middle of the state.
There is much cedar on the north slope. Oak, maple and beech are
rather scarce. A new growth of white pine and other timber is
gradually becoming valuable. The value of the timber product
increased from $11,849,654 in 1890 to $13,489,401 in 1900, and to
$17,937,683 in 1905.</p>

<p><i>Fisheries.</i>&mdash;Fishing has always been an important industry in
Maine. From 1901 to 1904 inclusive, the average annual catch
amounted to 195,335,646 &#8468;, and its average value was $5,557,083.
In 1908, according to state reports, the catch was 185,476,343 &#8468;,
valued at $3,849,900. Herrings are caught in largest quantities
(in 1908, according to state reports, 68,210,800 &#8468;, valued at
$450,665), and Maine is noted for the canning of the smaller herrings
under the name of &ldquo;sardines.&rdquo; In 1908, according to state
reports, the take of lobsters was 17,635,980 &#8468; valued at $1,558,252.
Maine markets more clams than any other state in the Union,
and the catches of cod, hake, haddock, smelt, mackerel, swordfish,
shad, pollock, cusk, salmon, alewives, eels and halibut are of
importance. The scallop fishery is becoming more and more
valuable. For the protection and promotion of the lobster fishery
the United States government has established a lobster hatchery
at Boothbay Harbor; and the state legislature enacted a law in
1895 prohibiting the taking of lobsters less than 10-1/2 in. in length
(one effect of this law being to drive the lobster-canning industry
from the state) and another law in 1903 for the protection of lobsters
with eggs attached. This latter law directs the state fish commissioner
to purchase such lobsters whenever caught and either to
liberate them or to sell them to the United States for keeping in a
fish hatchery.</p>

<p><i>Minerals.</i>&mdash;The principal mineral products are granite, limestone,
slate, clay products and mineral waters. In 1905 Maine held first
rank among the states of the Union as a producer of granite, the
value of the output being $2,713,795. In 1907 Maine&rsquo;s granite
was valued at $2,146,420, that of Massachusetts at $2,328,777,
and that of Vermont at $2,693,889. The stone is of superior
quality, and the largest part of it is used for building purposes;
much of it is used as paving blocks and some for monuments. It
abounds all along the coast east of the Kennebec and on the adjacent
islands, and is found farther inland, especially about the Rangeley
lakes in Franklin and Oxford counties, and, near Mt Katahdin,
in Penobscot and Piscataquis counties. The principal quarries,
however, are situated in positions most convenient for shipment by
water, in the vicinity of Penobscot bay and in Kennebec county,
and these have supplied the bulk of the material used in the construction
of many prominent buildings and monuments in the
United States. The Fox Island granite comes from the quarries on
Vinalhaven Island and the surrounding islands, and on Vinalhaven
were quarried monolithic columns 51.5 to 54 ft. long and 6 ft.
in diameter for the Cathedral of St John the Divine in New
York City. Black granite was quarried in 1907 at 12 quarries,
in York, Lincoln, Waldo, Penobscot and Washington counties.
Limestone abounds, especially in the south-east part of the
state, but it is quarried chiefly in Knox county. As its colour&mdash;blue
and blue-black streaked with white&mdash;renders it undesirable
for building purposes, nearly all of it is burned into
lime, which has become a very important article of manufacture
in the city of Rockland; the industry dates back to
1733 in Knox county. In 1907 the quantity of lime burned in
Maine was 159,494 tons and its value was $747,947. Slate is
quarried chiefly in Piscataquis county, most of it being used for
roofing, but some for blackboards; in 1907 the amount quarried
in Maine was valued at $236,106. About 1896 some remarkably
white and pure feldspar began to be quarried in Androscoggin,
Oxford and Sagadahoc counties, but afterwards the spar mined
in Maine was of less excellent quality; in 1907 the production in
Maine was valued at $157,334, the total for the entire country being
$499,069. Clay is obtained in various places, and in 1905 the total
value of the clay products was $619,294. In Oxford county
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page436" id="page436"></a>436</span>
tourmaline, spodumene (or kunzite) and beryl occur, the tourmaline
crystals being notably large and beautiful. Mineral water occurs
in many localities, particularly in Androscoggin, York, Cumberland
and Oxford counties; the most famous springs are the Poland
Springs in Androscoggin county. Most of the mineral waters
bottled in the state are chalybeate and slightly alkaline&mdash;saline;
their average temperature is about 43°. In 1908 27 springs were
reported, their aggregate sales amounting to 1,182,322 gallons.
Copper, gold alloyed with platinum, iron ore, barytes, graphite and
lead occur in small quantities in the state. In 1908 the total mineral
product of the state was valued at $7,044,678.</p>

<p><i>Manufactures.</i>&mdash;Although Maine has no coal and only a very
small amount of iron ore within her borders for the encouragement
of manufacturing, yet the abundance of fine timber and the numerous
coves, bays and navigable streams along or near the coast promoted
ship-building from the first, and this was the leading industry
of the state until about the middle of the 19th century, when
wooden ships began to be supplanted by those of iron and steel.
Until about the same time, when the Maine liquor law was passed,
the manufacture of rum from molasses, received in exchange for
lumber and fish in the West Indies, was also an important industry.
It was not until early in the 19th century that the large and constant
supply of water power afforded by the rivers began to be used to
any considerable extent. The first cotton mill was built at Brunswick
on the Androscoggin about 1809, and from 1830 the development
of cotton manufacturing was rapid; woollen mills followed,
and late in the 19th century were erected some of the largest paper
and pulp mills in the country, which are run by water power from
the rivers, and use the spruce and poplar timber in the river basins.
The total value of the manufactures of the state increased from
$95,689,500 in 1890 to $127,361,485 in 1900; and in 1905 the value
of factory-made products alone was $144,020,197, or 27.5%
greater than their value in 1900.<a name="fa3h" id="fa3h" href="#ft3h"><span class="sp">3</span></a> Measured by the value of the
output, paper and wood pulp rose from fifth among the state&rsquo;s
manufactures in 1890 to third in 1900 and to first in 1905; from
$3,281,051 in 1890 to $13,223,275 in 1900, an increase of 303%
within the decade, and to $22,951,124 in 1905, a further increase
of 73.6% in this period. Lumber and timber products
ranked second (1905)&mdash;$11,849,654 in 1890, $13,489,401 in 1900,
and $17,937,683 in 1905. Cotton goods ranked third (1905) in
value&mdash;$15,316,909 in 1890, $14,631,086 in 1900, and $15,404,823 in
1905. Woollen goods ranked fourth (1905)&mdash;$8,737,653 in 1890,
$13,744,126 in 1900, an increase of 57.3% within the decade; and
the value of the factory-made product alone in 1905 was $13,969,600,
or 20.1% greater than in 1900. Boots and shoes ranked fifth (1905)&mdash;$12,295,847
in 1900, and $12,351,293 in 1905. Fish, canned and
preserved, followed next, $1,660,881 in 1890 and $4,779,773 in
1900, an increase within the decade of 187.8%, most of which
was in one branch&mdash;the canning of small herring under the
name &ldquo;sardines&rdquo;; from 1900 to 1905 the increase was slight,
only $275,358, or 5.8%. In the value of its manufactures as
compared with those of the other states of the Union, in wooden
ships and boats, Maine in 1900 and in 1905 was outranked by New
York only; in canned and preserved fish by Washington only (the
value of fish canned and preserved in Maine in 1900 was 21.7%
of the total for the United States, and in 1905 19.2%); in the
output of woollen mills by Massachusetts and Pennsylvania only;
in the output of paper mills by New York and Massachusetts only.
It ranked ninth in 1900 and tenth in 1905 in the value of its cotton
goods. Portland, Lewiston, Biddeford, and Auburn are the leading
manufacturing cities, and in 1905 the total value of their manufactures
was 21.5% of those of the entire state. But from
1900 to 1905 the value of manufactures grew most rapidly in Rockland
(especially noted for lime), the increase being from $1,243,881
to $1,822,591 (46.5%), and in Waterville, where the increase
was from $2,283,536 to $3,069,309 (34.4%). Among the largest
paper mills are those at Millinocket, in Penobscot county, at
Madison on the Kennebec river, and at Rumford Falls on the
Androscoggin river. Lewiston leads in the manufacture of cotton
goods; Auburn, Bangor and Augusta, in the manufacture of boots
and shoes; Bath, in ship and boat building; Eastport and Lubec,
in canning &ldquo;sardines.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Transportation and Commerce.</i>&mdash;The south-western part of the state,
including the manufacturing, the quarrying, and much of the older
agricultural district, early had fairly satisfactory means of transportation
either by water or by rail; for the coast has many excellent
harbours, the Kennebec river is navigable for coast vessels to
Augusta, the Penobscot to Bangor, and railway service was soon
supplied for the villages of the south-west, but it was not until the
last decade of the 19th century that the forests, the farming lands,
and the summer resorts of Aroostook county were reached by a
railway, the Bangor &amp; Aroostook. The first railway in the state,
from Bangor to Old Town, was completed in 1836, and the state&rsquo;s
railway mileage increased from 12 m. in that year to 245 m. in
1850, to 1377.47 m. in 1890, and to 2210.79 in January 1909.
The principal railway systems are the Maine Central, which enters
every county but one, the Boston &amp; Maine, the Bangor &amp; Aroostook,
the Grand Trunk and the Canadian Pacific. Lines of steamboats
ply regularly between the largest cities of the state and Boston,
between Portland and New York, and between Portland and several
Canadian ports.</p>

<p>The foreign trade, especially that with the West Indies and with
Great Britain, decreased after 1875, and yet much trade from the
West that goes to Montreal during the warmer months passes
through Portland during the winter season. The chief exports to
foreign countries are textile fabrics, Indian corn, meat, dairy
products, apples, paraffin, boards and shooks; the chief imports
from foreign countries are sugar, molasses and wool. Fish,
canned goods, potatoes, granite, lime, paper, and boots and shoes
are also exported to foreign countries to some extent, but they
are shipped in larger quantities to other states of the Union, from
which Maine receives in return cotton, coal, iron, oil, &amp;c. The
ports of entry in Maine are Bangor, Bath, Belfast, Castine, Eastport,
Ellsworth, Houlton, Kennebunk, Machias, Portland, Wiscasset and
York.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Population.</i>&mdash;The population in 1880 was 648,936; in 1890,
661,086; in 1900, 694,466; and in 1910, 742,371.<a name="fa4h" id="fa4h" href="#ft4h"><span class="sp">4</span></a> From 1880 to
1900 there was an increase of only 7%, a percentage which was
exceeded in every other state in the Union except Nevada
and Vermont. Of the total population of 1900, 599,291, or
86.3%, were native whites, 93,330 were foreign-born, 1,319
were negroes, 798 were Indians, 119 were Chinese, and 4 were
Japanese. Of the inhabitants born in the United States,
588,211, or 97.8%, were natives of New England and 560,506
were natives of Maine, and of the foreign-born 67,077, or 71.8%,
were natives of Canada (36,169 English and 30,908 French),
and 10,159, or 10.8%, were natives of Ireland. Of the total population,
199,734 were of foreign parentage&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> either one or both
parents were foreign-born&mdash;and 89,857 were of Canadian parentage,
both on the father&rsquo;s and on the mother&rsquo;s side (41,355 English
and 48,502 French). The French-speaking inhabitants probably
number considerably more than 50,000. They are of two
quite distinct classes. One, numbering about 15,000, includes
those who became citizens by the establishment of the northern
boundary in 1842 and their descendants. They are largely
of Acadian stock. The state has established among them a
well-appointed training school for teachers, conducted in the
English language, the graduates of which render excellent
service in the common schools. The other class is of French-Canadian
immigrants, who find profitable employment in the
manufacturing centres. The colony of Swedes established
by the state near its north-eastern border in 1870 has proved
in every way successful. The Indians are remnants of the
Penobscot and Passamaquoddy tribes, the Passamaquoddies
being a little the more numerous. The Penobscots&rsquo; chief
gathering places are on the islands of the Penobscot river north
of Old Town; the Passamaquoddies&rsquo;, on the shores of Passamaquoddy
Bay and the banks of the Saint Croix river.</p>

<p>Roman Catholics are more numerous than all the Protestant
sects taken together, having in 1906 a membership of 113,419
out of a total of 212,988 in all denominations. In the last
decade of the 19th century the urban population (<i>i.e.</i> population
of places having 4,000 inhabitants or more) increased
from 226,268 to 251,685, or 11.2%; the semi-urban population
(<i>i.e.</i> population of incorporated places, or the approximate
equivalent, having less than 4,000 inhabitants) increased from
14,221 to 26,674, or 87.5%; while the rural population (<i>i.e.</i> population
outside of incorporated places) decreased from 420,597 to
416,134, or 1%. The principal cities of the state are: Portland,
pop. (1910), 58,571; Lewiston, 26,247; Bangor, 24,803; Biddeford,
17,079; Auburn, 15,064; Augusta (the capital), 13,211; Waterville,
11,458; Bath, 9,396; Westbrook, 8,281; and Rockland, 8,174.</p>

<p><i>Administration.</i>&mdash;Maine has had but one state constitution;
this was ratified in December 1819, about three months before
the admission of the state into the Union. It admits of amendment
by a two-thirds vote of both houses of the legislature
followed by a majority vote of the electorate at the next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page437" id="page437"></a>437</span>
September election; or, as provided by an amendment adopted in
1875, the legislature may by a two-thirds vote of each house
summon a constitutional convention. From 1819 to 1875
twelve amendments were adopted; in 1875, after nine more were
added, the twenty-one were incorporated in the text; and
between 1875 and 1899 nine more were adopted. Suffrage is
conferred by the constitution on all male citizens of the United
States who are at least twenty-one years of age and have, for
some other reason than because of being in the military, naval
or marine service of the United States, or of being students at
college, lived in the state for three months next preceding any
election; the following classes, however, are excepted: paupers,
persons under guardianship, Indians not taxed, and, as provided
by an amendment adopted in 1892, persons intellectually incapable
of reading the state constitution in the English language
or of writing their names. State elections were annual until
1897 when they were made biennial; they are held on the second
Monday in September in even numbered years, Maine being
one of the few states in the Union in which they are not held in
November.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The governor is the only executive officer of the state elected by
popular vote. There is no lieutenant-governor, the president of
the Senate succeeding to the office of governor in case of a vacancy,
but there is a council of seven members elected by the legislature
(not more than one from any one senatorial district), whose sole
function is to advise the governor. The governor&rsquo;s term of office
is two years (before 1879 it was one year); and the constitution
further directs that he shall be at least thirty years of age at the
beginning of his term, that he shall be a native-born citizen of the
United States, that when elected he shall have been a resident of
the state for five years, and that he shall reside in the state while in
office. His power of appointment is unusually extensive and the
advice and consent of the council (instead of that of the Senate
as in other states) are required for his appointments. He
appoints all judges, coroners and notaries public, besides
all other civil and military officers for whose appointment
neither the constitution nor the laws provide otherwise. The
governor is commander-in-chief of the state militia. Any bill
of which he disapproves he can within five days after its
passage prevent from becoming a law unless it is passed over his
veto by a two-thirds vote of each house of the legislature. He and
the council examine and pass upon election returns; he may summon
extra sessions of the legislature, and he may grant pardons, reprieves,
and commutations in all cases except impeachment, but
the manner of hearing applications for pardon is in a measure prescribed
by statute, and he must present to the legislature an account
of each case in which he grants a pardon. His salary is $2,000 a
year. The seven members of the council, the secretary of state,
the treasurer, the attorney general and the commissioner of agriculture
are elected biennially by a joint ballot of the two houses
of the legislature, which also elects, one every two years, the three
state assessors, whose term is six years.</p>

<p>The legislature meets biennially at Augusta, the capital, and is
composed of a Senate of thirty-one members and a House of Representatives
of one hundred and fifty-one members. Members of
each house are elected for a term of two years: one senator from
each senatorial district and one to seven representatives (one for
a population of 1,500, and seven for a population of 26,250) from
each township, or, where the township or plantation has less than
1,500 inhabitants, from each representative district, according to
its population. There is a new reapportionment every ten years,
counting from 1821. Every senator and every representative must
at the beginning of his term have been for five years a citizen of
the United States, for one year a resident of the state, and for three
months next preceding his election, as well as during his term of
office, a resident of the township or district which he represents;
and every senator must be at least twenty-five years of age. All
revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives, but
to such bills the Senate may propose amendments provided they
relate solely to raising revenue. Other bills may originate in either
house. In September 1908 a constitutional amendment was
adopted providing for referendum and initiative by the people.
Any bill proposed in the legislature or passed by it must be referred
to popular vote before becoming law, if there is a referendum
petition therefor signed by 10,000 voters; and a petition signed by
12,000 voters initiates new legislation.</p>

<p>At the head of the department of justice is the supreme judicial
court, which consists of a chief justice and seven associate justices
appointed by the governor and council for a term of seven years.
When it sits as a law court, at least five of its justices must be present,
and it holds three such sessions annually: one at Augusta, one at
Bangor, and one at Portland. But only one of its justices is required
for a trial court, and trial courts are held two or three times
a year in each county for the trial of both civil and criminal cases
which come before it in the first instance or upon appeal. In
Cumberland and Kennebec counties there is a superior court presided
over by one justice and having extensive civil and criminal
jurisdiction; and in each of the counties there are a probate court
for the settlement of the estates of deceased persons and courts
of the trial justice and the justice of the peace for the trial of petty
offences and of civil cases in which the debt or damage involved
does not exceed $20.</p>

<p>The principal forms of local government are the town (or township),
the plantation, the county and the city. As in other parts
of New England, the town is the most important of these. At the
regular town meeting held in March the electorate of the town
assembles, decides what shall be done for the town during the
ensuing year, elects officers to execute its decisions with limited
discretion, and votes money to meet the expenses. The principal
officers are the selectmen (usually three), town clerk, assessors,
collector, treasurer, school committee and road commissioner. A
populous section of a town, in order to promote certain financial
ends, is commonly incorporated as a village without however
becoming a governing organization distinct from the town. Maine
is the only state in the Union that retains what is known as the
organized plantation. This is a governmental unit organized from
an unincorporated township having at least 200 inhabitants,<a name="fa5h" id="fa5h" href="#ft5h"><span class="sp">5</span></a> and
its principal officers are the moderator, clerk, three assessors,
treasurer, collector, constable and school committee. The county
is a sort of intermediate organization between the state and the
towns to assist chiefly in the administration of justice, especially in
the custody of offenders, and in the making and care of roads. Its
officers are three commissioners, a treasurer, a register of deeds, a
judge and a register of probate, and a sheriff. They are all elected:
the commissioners for a term of six years, one retiring every two
years, the register of deeds and the judge and the register of probate
for a term of four years, and the others for two years. Among other
duties the commissioners care for county property, manage county
business and take charge of county roads. Maine has no general
law under which cities are chartered, and does not even set a minimum
population. A town may, therefore, be incorporated as a
city whenever it can obtain from the legislature a city charter which
a majority of its electorate prefers to a continuance under its town
government; consequently there is much variety in the government
of the various cities of the state.</p>

<p>By the laws of Maine the property rights of a wife are approximately
equal to those of a husband. A woman does not lose
nor a man acquire right to property by marriage, and a wife
may manage, sell, or will her property without the assent of
her husband. She may even receive as her own the wages of
her personal labour which was not performed for her own family.
In the absence of a will, bar or release, there is no legal distinction
between the rights of a widower in the estate of his deceased
wife and those of a widow in the estate of her deceased husband.
The grounds for divorce in the state are adultery, impotence,
extreme cruelty, desertion for three consecutive years next
preceding the application, gross and confirmed habits of intoxication,
cruel and abusive treatment, or a husband&rsquo;s gross or
wanton refusal or neglect to provide a suitable maintenance
for his wife.</p>

<p>Under the laws of Maine a householder owning and occupying
a house and lot may hold the same, or such part of it as does not
exceed $500 in value, as a homestead exempt from attachment,
except for the satisfaction of liens for labour or material, by
filing in the registry of deeds a certificate stating his desire for
such an exemption, provided he is not the owner of an exempted
lot purchased from the state; and the exemption may be continued
during the widowhood of his widow or the minority
of his children. A considerable amount of personal property,
including apparel, household furniture not exceeding $100 in
value, a library not exceeding $150 in value, interest in a pew
in a meeting-house, and a specified amount of fuel, provisions,
tools or farming implements, and domestic animals, and one
fishing boat, is also exempt from attachment.</p>

<p>Maine was the first state in the Union to enact a law for
prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors. An act for restricting
the sale of such liquors was passed in 1846; the first prohibitory
act was passed, largely through the influence of Neal Dow, in
1851; this was frequently amended; and in 1884 an amendment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page438" id="page438"></a>438</span>
to the constitution was adopted which declares the manufacture
of intoxicating liquors and their sale, except &ldquo;for medicinal and
mechanical purposes and the arts,&rdquo; forever prohibited. By
the law enacted for enforcing this prohibition the governor and
council appoint a state liquor commissioner from whom alone
the selectmen of a town, the mayor or aldermen of a city, are
authorized to receive the liquors which may be sold within
the exceptions named in the amendment, and the selectmen,
mayor or aldermen appoint an agent who alone is authorized to
sell any of these liquors within their jurisdiction and who is
forbidden to sell any whatever to minors, Indians, soldiers and
drunkards. But the law labours under the disadvantage of
all laws not vigorously sustained by general public sentiment,
and is grossly violated. For the most part it is executed to
the degree demanded by local sentiment in the several municipalities,
thus operating in practice much the same as a &ldquo;local
option&rdquo; law. The law looks to checking the demand by preventing
the supply; and since habitual reliance on the stringency
of law tends to the neglect of other influences for the removal of
evils from the community, the citizens seem to absolve themselves
from personal responsibility, both for the execution of
the law and for the existence of the evil itself. There has been
a strong movement for the repeal of the law, and the question
of prohibition has long been an important one in state politics.</p>

<p>The death penalty was abolished in Maine in 1876, restored
in 1883, and again abolished in 1887.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Penal and Charitable Institutions.</i>&mdash;The state penal and reformatory
institutions consist of the state prison at Thomaston, the state
(reform) school for boys at South Portland, and a state industrial
school for girls at Hallowell, established in 1875 and taken over by
the state in 1899. The two schools are not places of punishment, but
reformatory schools for delinquent boys (from 8 to 16 years of
age) and girls (from 6 to 16 years), who have been committed by the
courts for violations of law, and, in the case of girls, who, by force
of circumstances or associations, are &ldquo;in manifest danger of becoming
outcasts of society.&rdquo; The prison is in charge of a board
of three inspectors and a warden, and each of the other two institutions
is in charge of a board of trustees; the inspectors, warden, and
trustees are all appointed by the governor and council. Convicts
in the prison are usually employed in the manufacture of articles
that are not extensively made elsewhere in the state, such as carriages,
harness, furniture and brooms. The inmates of the state
school for boys receive instruction in farming, carpentry, tailoring,
laundry work, and various other trades and occupations; and the
girls in the state industrial school are trained in housework, laundering,
dressmaking, &amp;c. Paupers are cared for chiefly by the towns and
cities, those wholly dependent being placed in almshouses and those
only partially dependent receiving aid at their homes. The charitable
institutions maintained by the state are: the military and
naval orphan asylum at Bath, the Maine institution for the blind
at Portland, the Maine school for the deaf (established in 1876, and
taken over by the state in 1897) at Portland, the Maine insane
hospital at Augusta, the Eastern Maine insane hospital at Bangor,
and a school for the feeble-minded (established in 1907) at West
Pownal, each of which is governed by trustees appointed by the
governor and council, with the exception of a part of those of the
orphan asylum, who are appointed by the corporation. Besides the
strictly state institutions, there are a number of private charitable
institutions which are assisted by state funds; among these are the
eye and ear infirmary at Portland, the Maine state sanatorium at
Hebron for the treatment of tuberculosis, and various hospitals,
orphanages, &amp;c. The national government has a branch of the
national home for disabled volunteer soldiers at Togus, and a marine
hospital at Portland.</p>

<p><i>Education.</i>&mdash;The school-district system was established in 1800
while Maine was still a part of Massachusetts and was maintained
by the first school law passed, in 1821, by the state legislature; but,
beginning in the next year, one town after another received the
privilege of abolishing its districts, and in 1893 the system was
abolished by act of the legislature. A state board of education,
composed of one member from each county, was established in
1846, but for this was substituted, in 1852, a commissioner of
schools for each county, appointed by the governor, and two years
later a state superintendent of schools was substituted for the
county commissioners. County supervision by county supervisors
was tried in 1869-1872. Since these several changes the common
school system has been administered by towns and cities subject
to an increasing amount of control through enactments of the state
legislature and the general supervision of the state superintendent.
The town officers are a superintending school committee of three
members and a superintendent. The members of the committee
are elected for a term of three years, one retiring every year, and
women as well as men are eligible for the office. The superintendent
may be elected by the town or appointed by the committee, or
towns having not less than twenty or more than fifty schools may
unite in employing a superintendent. In cities the committee is
usually larger than in towns and is commonly elected by wards.
Since 1889 each town and city has been required to furnish textbooks,
apparatus and supplies, without cost to the pupils. The
minimum length of the school year is fixed by a statute of 1893 at
twenty weeks; the average length is about twenty-eight weeks.
A compulsory education law, enacted in 1901, requires the attendance
at some public or approved private school of each child between
the ages of seven and fifteen during all the time that school is in
session, except that necessary absences may be excused. For the
maintenance of the common schools each town is required (since
1905) to raise annually at least fifty-five cents <i>per capita</i>, exclusive
of what may be received from other sources, and to this is added
the proceeds of a state tax of one and a half mills on a dollar, one-half
the proceeds of the tax on savings banks, a 6% income from
the permanent school fund (derived mainly from the sale of school
lands), and state appropriations for the payment in part of the
superintendence in towns that have united for that purpose. Any
section of a town may establish and maintain a high school provided
there be not more than two such schools in one town, and the
state makes appropriations for the support of such schools equal
to one-half the cost of instruction, but the maximum grant to any
one such school is $250.</p>

<p>The state maintains five normal schools: that at Farmington
(established 1864), that at Castine (1866), that at Gorham (1879);
that at Presque Isle (the Aroostook state normal school, 1903),
and the Madawaska training school at Fort Kent, each of which is
under the direction of a board of trustees consisting of the governor,
the state superintendent of schools, and five other members appointed
by the governor and council for not more than three years.
At the head of the public school system is the university of Maine,
near the village of Orono in Orono township (pop. in 1900, 3257),
Penobscot county. This institution was founded in 1865 as the
state college of agriculture and the mechanic arts; in 1897 the present
name was adopted. It embraces a college of arts and sciences, a
college of agriculture, a college of technology (including a department
of forestry), a college of law (at Bangor), and a college of
pharmacy. The most conspicuous of its twenty-five buildings is
the library, built with funds contributed by Andrew Carnegie. In
1908-1909 the university had 104 instructors and 884 students, of
whom 113 were in the college of law at Bangor and 420 in the college
of technology. The university is maintained with the proceeds of
an endowment fund derived chiefly from public lands given by the
national government in accordance with the land grant, or Morrill,
Act of 1862 (see Morrill, Justin S.) and from the bequest ($100,000)
of Abner Coburn (1803-1885); by appropriations of Congress under
the second Morrill Act (1890), and under the Nelson Amendment
of 1907, by appropriations of the state legislature, and by fees paid
by the students. Connected with the university is an agricultural
experiment station, established and maintained under the Hatch
Act (1887) and the Adams Act (1906) of the national Congress.
The government of the university is entrusted, subject to inspection
of the governor and council, to a board of eight trustees. Among
the important institutions of learning which have no official connexion
with the state are Bowdoin College (opened in 1802), at
Brunswick; Colby College (Baptist, opened in 1818), at Waterville;
and Bates College (originally Free Baptist but now unsectarian;
opened in 1863), at Lewiston. In 1900 5.1% of the state&rsquo;s inhabitants
ten years of age and over were illiterate (<i>i.e.</i> could
neither read nor write, or could read but not write); of the native
whites within this age limit 2.4% were illiterate, of the foreign
whites, 19.4%. Of the foreign-born whites 15.7% were unable to
speak English.</p>

<p><i>Finance.</i>&mdash;The chief sources of the state&rsquo;s revenue are a general
property tax and taxes on the franchises of corporations, especially
those of railway and insurance companies and savings banks;
among the smaller sources are licences or fees, a poll tax, and a
collateral inheritance tax. The general property tax for state and
local purposes is assessed by local assessors, but their work is reviewed
for the purpose of equalization among the several towns
and counties by a board of state assessors, which also assesses the
corporations. This board of three members (not more than two
of whom may be of the same political party) is elected by a joint
ballot of the two houses of the legislature for a term of six years,
one member retiring every two years. The state is prohibited by
the constitution from creating a debt exceeding $300,000 except
for the suppression of a rebellion, for repelling an invasion, or for
war purposes; and every city and town is forbidden by an amendment
adopted in 1877 from creating one exceeding 5% of
the assessed value of its property. But the state was authorized
by an amendment adopted in 1868 to issue bonds for the reimbursement
of the expenses incurred by its cities, towns, and plantations on
account of the Civil War, and these bonds, with those issued by
the state itself during the Civil War, constituted the largest part
of the state&rsquo;s bonded indebtedness. The bonded debt, however,
is rapidly being paid; in January 1901 it was $2,103,000, and in
January 1909 only $698,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page439" id="page439"></a>439</span></p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;During the 16th century and the early part of the
17th, the coast of Maine attracted various explorers, among
them Giovanni da Verrazano (1524), Estéban Gomez (1525),
Bartholomew Gosnold (1602), Martin Pring (1603), Pierre du
Guast, Sieur De Monts (1604), George Weymouth (1605), and
John Smith (1614), who explored and mapped the coast and
gave to the country the name New England; but no permanent
English settlement was established within what are now the
borders of the state until some time between 1623 and 1629.
In 1603 De Monts received from Henry IV. of France a charter
for all the region between 40° and 46° N. under the name of
Acadie, or Acadia, and in 1604 he built a fort on Neutral Island
at the mouth of the Saint Croix river. This he abandoned in
1605, but some of his followers were in the vicinity a few years
later. In the same year George Weymouth explored the south-west
coast, kidnapped five Indians, and carried them to England,
where three of them lived for a time in the family of Sir Ferdinando
Gorges, who soon became the leader in founding Maine.
In 1607 the Plymouth Company, of which he was an influential
member and which had received a grant of this region from
James I. of England in the preceding year, sent out a colony
numbering 120 under George Popham (<i>c.</i> 1550-1608), brother
of Sir John Popham, and Raleigh Gilbert, son of Sir Humphrey
Gilbert. The colony established itself at the mouth of the
Kennebec river in August, but, finding its supplies insufficient,
about three-fifths of its number returned to England in
December; a severe winter followed and Popham died; then
Gilbert, who succeeded to the presidency of the council for the
colony, became especially interested in his claim to the territory
under his father&rsquo;s charter,<a name="fa6h" id="fa6h" href="#ft6h"><span class="sp">6</span></a> and in 1608 the colony was abandoned.
In 1609 the French Jesuits Biard and Masse established a
fortified mission station on the island of Mount Desert, and
although this as well as the remnant of De Monts&rsquo; settlement
at the mouth of the Saint Croix was taken in 1613 by Sir Samuel
Argall (d. 1626), acting under the instructions of the English at
Jamestown, Virginia, some of these colonists returned later.
In 1620 the Council for New England, the successor of the
Plymouth Company, obtained a grant of the country between
latitude 40° and 48° N. extending from sea to sea, and two years
later Gorges and John Mason (1586-1635) received from the
Council a grant of the territory between the Merrimac and the
Kennebec rivers for 60 m. inland under the name of the Province
of Maine. In 1629 they divided their possession, Gorges taking
the portion between the Piscataqua and the Kennebec. Numerous
grants of land in this vicinity followed within a few years; and
in the meantime permanent settlements at York, Saco, Biddeford,
Port Elizabeth, Falmouth (now Portland) and Scarborough
were established in rapid succession. The Council for New
England surrendered its charter in 1635. In the division of its
territory Gorges retained the portion previously granted to him,
and the region between the Kennebec and the Saint Croix north
to the Saint Lawrence, though still claimed by the French as
part of Acadia, was conveyed to Sir William Alexander (1567?-1640);
later, in 1664, this was conveyed to the duke of York,
afterwards James II. of England.</p>

<p>Gorges named his tract the County of New Somersetshire,
and immediately began the administration of government, setting
up in 1635 or 1636 a court at Saco under the direction of his
kinsman William Gorges. In 1639 he procured for his province
a royal charter modelled after that of Maryland, which invested
him with the feudal tenure of a county palatine and vice-regal
powers of government. He called into existence a formidably
large number of officers to govern it, but his charter was in
conflict with the other (mutually conflicting) grants of the
Council for New England, east of the Piscataqua; and Gorges
and his agents met with a determined opposition under the
leadership of George Cleeve, the deputy-president of the Lygonia,
or &ldquo;Plough&rdquo; Patent, which extended along the coast from
Cape Porpoise to Casco, and in issuing which the Council for
New England had granted governmental as well as territorial
rights. Moreover, Puritan Massachusetts, which was naturally
hostile to the Anglicanism of Gorges and his followers, interpreted
her charter so as to make her northern boundary run
east and west from a point 3 m. north of the source of the Merrimac
river, and on this basis laid claim to practically the whole
of Maine then settled. The factional quarrels there, together
with the Commonwealth government in England, made it easy
for Massachusetts to enforce this claim at the time, and between
1652 and 1658 Maine was gradually annexed to Massachusetts.
In 1672 Massachusetts extended her boundary eastward as far as
Penobscot Bay. Ferdinando Gorges, a grandson of the original
proprietor, brought before parliament his claim to Maine and
in 1664 a committee of that body decided in his favour; but
Massachusetts successfully resisted until 1677, when the king
in council decided against her. She then quietly purchased
the Gorges claim for £1,250 and held the province as a proprietor
until 1691, when by the new Massachusetts charter Maine was
extended to the Saint Croix river, and was made an integral
part of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The French still claimed all territory east of the Penobscot,
and not only was Maine an exposed frontier and battleground
during the long struggle of the English against the Indians and
the French, but its citizens bore a conspicuous part in the
expeditions beyond its borders. Port Royal was taken in May
1690 by Sir William Phipps and Louisburg in June 1745 by Sir
William Pepperell, both these commanders being from Maine.
These expeditions were such a drain on Maine&rsquo;s population that
Massachusetts was called upon to send men to garrison the little
forts that protected the homes left defenceless by men who had
gone to the front. During the War of Independence, the town
of Falmouth (now Portland), which had ardently resisted the
claims of the British, was bombarded and burned, in 1775; in
the same year Benedict Arnold followed the course of the Kennebec
and Dead rivers on his expedition to Quebec; and from 1779
to 1783 a British force was established at Castine. The embargo
and non-intercourse laws from 1807 to 1812 were a severe blow
to Maine&rsquo;s shipping, and in the War of 1812 Eastport, Castine,
Hampden, Bangor and Machias fell into the hands of the
British.</p>

<p>Maine was in general well governed as a part of Massachusetts,
but a geographical separation, a desire to be rid of the burden
of a large state debt, and a difference of economic interests as well
as of politics (Maine was largely Democratic and Massachusetts
was largely Federalist) created a desire for an independent
commonwealth. This was felt before the close of the War of
Independence and in 1785-1787 conventions were held at
Falmouth (Portland) to consider the matter, but the opposition
prevailed. The want of protection during the War of 1812
revived the question, and in 1816 the General Court in response to
a great number of petitions submitted to a vote in the towns
and plantations of the District the question: &ldquo;Shall the legislature
be requested to give its consent to the separation of
the District of Maine from Massachusetts, and the erection of
said District into a separate state?&rdquo; The returns showed 10,393
yeas to 6501 nays, but they also showed that less than one-half
the full vote had been cast. Acting upon these returns the
legislature passed a bill prescribing the terms of separation, and
directed another vote of the towns and plantations upon the
question of separation and the election of delegates to a convention
at Brunswick which should proceed to frame a constitution
in case the second popular vote gave a majority of five to
four for separation; but as that vote was only 11,969 yeas to
10,347 nays the advocates of separation were unsuccessful.
But a large source of opposition to separation was removed in
1819 when Congress, dividing the east coast of the United States
into two great districts, did away with the regulation which,
making each state a district for entering and clearing vessels,
would have required coasting vessels from the ports of Maine
as a separate state to enter and clear on every trip to or from
Boston; as a consequence, the separation measures were carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page440" id="page440"></a>440</span>
by large majorities this year, a constitution was framed by a
convention which met at Portland in October, this was ratified
by town meetings in December, and Maine applied for admission
into the Union. Owing to the peculiar situation at the
time in Congress, arising from the contest over the admission
of Missouri, the question of the admission of Maine became an
important one in national politics. By an Act of the 3rd of
March 1820, however, Maine was finally admitted into the
Union as a separate state, her admission being a part of the
Missouri compromise (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>The boundary on the north had not yet been ascertained,
and it had long been a subject of dispute between the United
States and Great Britain. The treaty of 1783 (Article II.) had
defined the north-east boundary of the United States as extending
along the middle of the river St Croix &ldquo;from its mouth in the
bay of Fundy to its source&rdquo; and &ldquo;due north from the source of
St Croix river to the highlands; along the said highlands which
divide those rivers that empty themselves into the river St
Lawrence from those which fall into the Atlantic Ocean, to the
north-westernmost head of Connecticut river; thence down
along the middle of that river to the forty-fifth degree of north
latitude.&rdquo; Great Britain claimed that the due north line was
40 m. long and ran to Mars Hill in Aroostook county, and that
the highlands ran thence westerly 115 m. to the source of the
Chaudière; the United States, on the other hand, claimed that
the northerly line was 140 m. long, running to highlands dividing
the Ristigouche and the tributaries of the Metis; and there was
a further disagreement with regard to the side of the highlands
on which the boundary should be, and as to what stream was
the &ldquo;north-westernmost head of Connecticut river.&rdquo; The
fifth article of the Jay treaty of 1794 provided for a commission
to decide what the St Croix river actually was, and this commission
in 1798 defined the St Croix, saying that its mouth
was in Passamaquoddy bay and that the boundary ran up this
river and the Cheputnatecook to a marked monument. The
treaty of Ghent in 1814 (Article IV.) referred the question of
the ownership of the islands in Passamaquoddy bay to a commission
which gave Moose, Dudley and Frederick islands to
the United States; and the same treaty by Article V. provided
for the survey (which was made in 1817-1818) of a part of
the disputed territory, and for a general commission. The
general commissioners met at St Andrews, N.B., in 1816, and
in New York City in 1822, only to disagree; and when the king
of the Netherlands, chosen as arbitrator in 1829 (under the
Convention of 1827) rendered in 1831 a decision against which
the state of Maine protested, the Federal Senate withheld its
assent to his decision. In 1838-1839 the territory in dispute
between New Brunswick and Maine became the scene of a border
&ldquo;war,&rdquo; known as the &ldquo;Aroostook disturbance&rdquo;; Maine erected
forts along the line she claimed, Congress authorized the president
to resist any attempt of Great Britain to enforce exclusive
jurisdiction over the disputed territory, and an armed conflict
seemed imminent. General Winfield Scott was sent to take
command on the Maine frontier, and on the 21st of March 1839
he arranged a truce and a joint occupancy of the territory in
dispute until a satisfactory settlement should be reached by
the United States and Great Britain. The Webster-Ashburton
treaty of 1842 was a compromise, which allowed Maine about
5500 sq. m. less than she had claimed and allowed Great Britain
about as much less than her claim; all grants of land previously
made by either party within the limits of the territory which
by this treaty fell within the dominions of the other party were
to be &ldquo;held valid, ratified and confirmed to the persons in
possession under such grants, to the same extent as if such
territory had ... fallen within the dominions of the party by
whom such grants were made&rdquo;; and the government of the
United States agreed to pay to Maine and Massachusetts<a name="fa7h" id="fa7h" href="#ft7h"><span class="sp">7</span></a> &ldquo;in
equal moieties&rdquo; the sum of $300,000 as compensation for the
lands which they had claimed and which under the treaty they
were called upon to surrender. The long controversy, which
is known in American history as &ldquo;The North-East boundary
dispute,&rdquo; was not finally settled however until 1910.</p>

<p>It was the Democratic majority in the district of Maine that
effected the separation from Massachusetts, and from the date
of that separation until 1853 Maine was classed as a Democratic
state, although it elected a Whig governor in 1838 and in 1840,
and cast its electoral vote for John Quincy Adams in 1824 and
1828 and for W. H. Harrison in 1840. As a result of the slavery
question, there was a party disintegration between 1850 and
1855, followed by the supremacy of the Republican party from
1856 to 1878. In 1878, of the 126,169 votes cast in the election
for governor, Selden Connor (b. 1839), re-nominated by the
Republicans, received 56,554; Joseph L. Smith (&ldquo;National&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Greenback&rdquo;), 41,371; Alonzo Garcelon (1813-1906) (Democratic),
28,218; as no candidate received a majority of the votes,
the election was left to the legislature.<a name="fa8h" id="fa8h" href="#ft8h"><span class="sp">8</span></a> The vote of the House
eliminated Connor, and Garcelon was chosen in the Senate by
a Democratic-National fusion. Again there was no election
by popular vote in 1879, and Garcelon and his council, to secure
the election of a fusion government, counted-in a fusion majority
in the legislature by evident falsification of the returns. On
the 3rd of January 1880 the Supreme Court declared the
governor and council in error in counting in a fusion majority,
but on the 7th the governor swore in a legislature with 78 fusion
and only two Republican members, and, the governor&rsquo;s term
having expired, the president of the Senate, James D. Lamson,
became governor, ex-officio. On the 12th the legislative
chambers were seized by the Republicans, whose organized
legislature was declared legal by the Supreme Court, and who
chose as governor Daniel Franklin Davis (1843-1897); whereupon,
on the 17th, Joshua L. Chamberlain, to whom the peaceful
solution of the difficulty had largely been due, retired from the
task assigned him by Garcelon on the 5th of January &ldquo;to protect
the public property and institutions of the state&rdquo; until Garcelon&rsquo;s
successor should be duly qualified. In 1880 the Democrats
and Greenbacks united and elected their candidate, but after
1883 Maine was strongly Republican until 1910.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAINE DE BIRAN, FRANÇOIS-PIERRE-GONTHIER<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> (1766-1824),
French philosopher, was born at Bergerac, on the 29th of
November, 1766. The name Maine he assumed (some time
before 1787) from an estate called Le Maine, near Mouleydier.
After studying with distinction under the <i>doctrinaires</i> of Périgueux,
he entered the life-guards of Louis XVI., and was present
at Versailles on the memorable 5th and 6th of October 1789.
On the breaking up of the <i>gardes du corps</i> Biran retired to his
patrimonial inheritance of Grateloup, near Bergerac, where his
retired life preserved him from the horrors of the Revolution.
It was at this period that, to use his own words, he &ldquo;passed
<i>per saltum</i> from frivolity to philosophy.&rdquo; He began with
psychology, which he made the study of his life. After the
Reign of Terror Maine de Biran took part in political affairs.
Having been excluded from the council of the Five Hundred
on suspicion of royalism, he took part with his friend Laîné
in the commission of 1813, which gave expression for the first
time to direct opposition to the will of the emperor. After the
Restoration he held the office of treasurer to the chamber of
deputies, and habitually retired during the autumn recess to
his native district to pursue his favourite study. He died on
the 20th (16th, or 23rd, according to others) of July 1824.</p>

<p>Maine de Biran&rsquo;s philosophical reputation has suffered from
two causes&mdash;his obscure and laboured style, and the fact that
only a few, and these the least characteristic, of his writings
appeared during his lifetime. These consisted of the essay on
habit (<i>Sur l&rsquo;influence de l&rsquo;habitude</i>, 1803), a critical review of
P. Laromiguière&rsquo;s lectures (1817), and the philosophical portion
of the article &ldquo;Leibnitz&rdquo; in the <i>Biographie universelle</i> (1819).
A treatise on the analysis of thought (<i>Sur la décomposition de
la pensée</i>), although sent to press, was never printed. In 1834
these writings, together with the essay entitled <i>Nouvelles considérations
sur les rapports du physique et du moral de l&rsquo;homme</i>,
were published by Victor Cousin, who in 1841 added three
volumes, under the title <i>&OElig;uvres philosophiques de Maine de
Biran</i>. But the publication (in 1859) by E. Naville (from MSS.
placed at his father&rsquo;s disposal by Biran&rsquo;s son) of the <i>&OElig;uvres
inédites de Maine de Biran</i>, in three volumes, first rendered
possible a connected view of his philosophical development.
At first a sensualist, like Condillac and Locke, next an intellectualist,
he finally shows himself a mystical theosophist. The
<i>Essai sur les fondements de la psychologie</i> represents the second or
completest stage of his philosophy, the fragments of the <i>Nouveaux
essais d&rsquo;anthropologie</i> the third.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Maine de Biran&rsquo;s first essays in philosophy were written avowedly
from the point of view of Locke and Condillac, but even in them he
was brought to signalize the essential fact on which his later speculation
turns. Dealing with the formation of habits, he is compelled
to note that passive impressions, however transformed, do not
furnish a complete or adequate explanation. With Laromiguière
he distinguishes attention as an active effort, of no less importance
than the passive receptivity of sense, and with Butler distinguishes
passively formed customs from active habits. He finally arrived
at the conclusion that Condillac&rsquo;s notion of passive receptivity as
the one source of conscious experience was not only an error in fact
but an error of method&mdash;in short, that the mechanical mode of
viewing consciousness as formed by external influence was fallacious
and deceptive. For it he proposed to substitute the genetic method,
whereby human conscious experience might be exhibited as growing
or developing from its essential basis in connexion with external
conditions. The essential basis he finds in the real consciousness,
of self as an active striving power, and the stages of its development,
corresponding to what one may call the relative importance of the
external conditions and the reflective clearness of self-consciousness
he designates as the affective, the perceptive and the reflective.
In connexion with this Biran treats most of the obscure problems
which arise in dealing with conscious experience, such as the mode
by which the organism is cognized, the mode by which the organism
is distinguished from extra-organic things, and the nature of those
general ideas by which the relations of things are known to us&mdash;cause,
power, force, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the latest stage of his speculation Biran distinguishes the
animal existence from the human, under which the three forms above
noted are classed, and both from the life of the spirit, in which
human thought is brought into relation with the supersensible,
divine system of things. This stage is left imperfect. Altogether
Biran&rsquo;s work presents a very remarkable specimen of deep metaphysical
thinking directed by preference to the psychological aspect
of experience.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAINE-ET-LOIRE,<a name="ar69" id="ar69"></a></span> a department of western France, formed in
1790 for the most part out of the southern portion of the former
province of Anjou, and bounded N. by the departments of
Mayenne and Sarthe, E. by Indre-et-Loire, S.E. by Vienne, S.
by Deux-Sèvres and Vendée, W. by Loire-Inférieure, and N.W.
by Ille-et-Vilaine. Area, 2786 sq. m. Pop. (1906), 513,490.
Maine-et-Loire is made up of two distinct regions, the line of
demarcation running roughly from north to south along the
valley of the Sarthe, then turning south-west and passing
Brissac and Doué; that to the west consists of granites, felspars,
and a continuation of the geological formations of Brittany
and Vendée; to the east, schists, limestone and chalk prevail.
The department is traversed from east to west by the majestic
valley of the Loire, with its rich orchards, nurseries and market-gardens.
The highest altitudes are found in the south-west,
where north-east of Cholet one eminence reaches 689 ft. Elsewhere
the surface is low and undulating in character. The
department belongs entirely to the basin of the Loire, the bed
of which is wide but shallow, and full of islands, the depth of
the water in summer being at some places little more than 2 ft.
Floods are sudden and destructive. The chief affluent of the
Loire within the department is the Maine, formed a little above
Angers by the junction of the Mayenne and the Sarthe, the
latter having previously received the waters of the Loire. All
three are navigable. Other tributaries of the Loire are the Thouet
(with its tributary the Dive), the Layon, the Evre, and the
Divatte on the left, and the Authion on the right. The Mayenne
is joined on the right by the Oudon, which can be navigated
below Segré. The Erdre, which joins the Loire at Nantes,
and the Moine, a tributary of the Sèvre-Nantaise, both rise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page442" id="page442"></a>442</span>
within this department. The climate is very mild. The mean
annual temperature of Angers is about 53°, slightly exceeding
that of Paris; the rainfall (between 23 and 24 in. annually)
is distinctly lower than that of the rest of France. Notwithstanding
this deficiency, the frequent fogs, combined with the
peculiar nature of the soil in the south-east of the department,
produce a degree of moisture which is highly favourable to
meadow growths. The winter colds are never severe, and
readily permit the cultivation of certain trees which cannot be
reared in the adjoining departments.</p>

<p>The agriculture of the department is very prosperous. The
produce of cereals, chiefly wheat, oats and barley, is in excess
of its needs, and potatoes and mangels also give good returns.
Extensive areas in the valley of the Loire are under hemp,
and the vegetables, melons and other fruits of that region are
of the finest quality. Good wine is produced at Serrant and
other places near Angers, and on the right bank of the Layon
and near Saumur, the sparkling white wine of which is a rival
of the cheaper brands of champagne. Cider is also produced,
and the cultivation of fruit is general. Forests and woodland
in which oak and beech are the chief trees cover large tracts.
The fattening of cattle is an important industry round Cholet,
and horses much used for light cavalry are reared. Several
thousand workmen are employed in the slate quarries in the
vicinity of Angers, tufa is worked in the river valleys, and
freestone and other stone, mispickel, iron and coal are also found.
Cholet, the chief industrial town, and its district manufacture
pocket-handkerchiefs, as well as linen cloths, flannels, cotton
goods, and hempen and other coarse fabrics, and similar industries
are carried on at Angers, which also manufactures liqueurs,
rope, boots and shoes and parasols. Saumur, besides its production
of wine, makes beads and enamels. The commerce of
Maine-et-Loire comprises the exportation of live stock and of the
various products of its soil and industries, and the importation
of hemp, cotton, and other raw materials. The department
is served by the railways of the state and the Orléans and
Western companies. The Mayenne, the Sarthe and the Loir,
together with some of the lesser rivers, provide about 130 m. of
navigable waterway. In the south-east the canal of the Dive
covers some 10 m. in the department.</p>

<p>There are five arrondissements&mdash;Angers, Baugé, Cholet,
Saumur and Segré, with 34 cantons and 381 communes. Maine-et-Loire
belongs to the académie (educational division) of
Rennes, to the region of the VIII. army corps, and to the ecclesiastical
province of Tours. Angers (<i>q.v.</i>), the capital, is the seat
of a bishopric and of a court of appeal. Other principal places
are Cholet, Saumur, and Fontevrault, which receive separate
treatment. For architectural interest there may also be mentioned
the châteaux of Brissac (17th century), Serrant (15th and
16th centuries), Montreuil-Bellay (14th and 15th centuries), and
Ecuillé (15th century), and the churches of Puy-Notre-Dame
(13th century) and St Florent-le-Vieil (13th, 17th, and 19th
centuries), the last containing the fine monument to Charles
Bonchamps, the Vendean leader, by David d&rsquo;Angers. Gennes
has remains of a theatre and other ruins of the Roman period,
as well as two churches dating in part from the 10th century.
Ponts-de-Cé, an interesting old town built partly on islands in
the Loire, is historically important, because till the Revolution
its bridges formed the only way across the Loire between
Saumur and Nantes.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAINPURI,<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Mynpooree</span>, a town and district of British
India, in the Agra division of the United Provinces. The town
has a station on a branch of the East Indian railway recently
opened from Shikohabad. Pop. (1901), 19,000. It consists
of two separate portions, Mainpuri proper and Mukhamganj.
Holkar plundered and burned part of the town in 1804, but was
repulsed by the local militia. Since the British occupation the
population has rapidly increased and many improvements have
been carried out. The Agra branch of the Grand Trunk road
runs through the town, forming a wide street lined on both sides
by shops, which constitute the principal bazaar. Mainpuri has
a speciality in the production of carved wooden articles inlaid
with brass wire. The American Presbyterian mission manages
a high school.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">District of Mainpuri</span> lies in the central Doab. Area,
1675 sq. m. Pop. (1901), 829,357, an increase of 8.8% in the
decade. It consists of an almost unbroken plain, intersected
by small rivers, with a few undulating sand ridges. It is wooded
throughout with mango groves, and isolated clumps of <i>bábul</i> trees
occasionally relieve the bareness of its saline <i>usar</i> plains. On the
south-western boundary the Jumna flows in a deep alluvial bed,
sometimes sweeping close to the high banks which overhang its
valley, and elsewhere leaving room for a narrow strip of fertile
soil between the river and the upland plain. From the low-lying
lands thus formed a belt of ravines stretches inland for
some 2 m., often covered with jungle, but affording good
pasturage for cattle. The district is watered by two branches
of the Ganges canal, and is traversed by the main line of the
East Indian railway.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Mainpuri anciently formed part of the great kingdom of Kanauj,
and after the fall of that famous state it was divided into a number
of petty principalities, of which Rapri and Bhongaon were the chief.
In 1194 Rapri was made the seat of a Moslem governor. Mainpuri
fell to the Moguls on Baber&rsquo;s invasion in 1526, and, although temporarily
wrested from them by the short-lived Afghan dynasty of
Shere Shah, was again occupied by them on the reinstatement of
Humayun after the victory of Panipat. Like the rest of the lower
Doab, Mainpuri passed, towards the end of the 18th century, into
the power of the Mahrattas, and finally became a portion of the
province of Oudh. When this part of the country was ceded to
the British, in 1801, Mainpuri town became the headquarters of
the extensive district of Etawah, which was in 1856 reduced by the
formation of Etah and Mainpuri into separate collectorates. On
the outbreak of the Mutiny in 1857 the regiment stationed at Mainpuri
revolted and attacked the town, which was successfully
defended by the few Europeans of the station for a week, until
the arrival of the Jhansi mutineers made it necessary to abandon
the district.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAINTENANCE<a name="ar71" id="ar71"></a></span> (Fr. <i>maintenance</i>, from <i>maintenir</i>, to maintain,
support, Lat. <i>manu tenere</i>, to hold in the hand). The action
of giving support, supplying means of subsistence, keeping
efficient or in working order. In English law maintenance is an
officious intermeddling in an action that in no way belongs to one
by maintaining or assisting either party, with money or otherwise,
to prosecute or defend it. It is an indictable offence, both at
common law and by statute, and punishable by fine and imprisonment.
It invalidates all contracts involving it. It is also
actionable. There are, however, certain cases in which maintenance
is justifiable, <i>e.g.</i> any one who has an interest, even if it
be only contingent, in the matter at variance can maintain
another in an action concerning the matter; or several parties
who have a common interest in the same thing may maintain
one another in a suit concerning the same. Neither is it reckoned
maintenance to assist another in his suit on charitable grounds,
or for a master to assist his servant, or a parent his son, or a
husband his wife. The law with regard to the subject is considered
at length in <i>Bradlaugh</i> v. <i>Newdegate</i>, 1883, 11 Q.B.D. 1.

<p>A <span class="scs">CAP OF MAINTENANCE</span>, <i>i.e.</i> a cap of crimson velvet turned up
with ermine, is borne, as one of the insignia of the British sovereign,
immediately before him at his coronation or on such state occasions
as the opening of parliament. It is carried by the hereditary
bearer, the marquess of Winchester, upon a white wand. A similar
cap is also borne before the lord mayor of London. The origin of
this symbol of dignity is obscure. It is stated in the <i>New English
Dictionary</i> that it was granted by the pope to Henry VII. and
Henry VIII. It is probably connected with the &ldquo;cap of estate&rdquo;
or &ldquo;dignity,&rdquo; sometimes also styled &ldquo;cap of maintenance,&rdquo; similar
to the royal symbol with two peaks or horns behind, which is borne
as a heraldic charge by certain families. It seems originally to
have been a privilege of dukes. Where it is used the crest is placed
upon it, instead of on the usual wreath.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAINTENON, FRANÇOISE D&rsquo;AUBIGNÉ,<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> <span class="sc">Marquise de</span>
(1635-1719), the second wife of Louis XIV., was born in a prison
at Niort, on the 27th of November 1635. Her father, Constant
d&rsquo;Aubigné, was the son of Agrippa d&rsquo;Aubigné, the famous friend
and general of Henry IV., and had been imprisoned as a Huguenot
malcontent, but her mother, a fervent Catholic, had the child
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page443" id="page443"></a>443</span>
baptized in her religion, her sponsors being the duc de la Rochefoucauld,
father of the author of the <i>Maxims</i>, and the comtesse de
Neuillant. In 1639 Constant d&rsquo;Aubigné was released from
prison and took all his family with him to Martinique, where he
died in 1645, after having lost what fortune remained to him at
cards. Mme d&rsquo;Aubigné returned to France, and from sheer
poverty unwillingly yielded her daughter to her sister-in-law,
Mme de Villette, who made the child very happy, but converted
or pretended to convert her to Protestantism. When this was
known an order of state was issued that she should be entrusted
to Mme de Neuillant, her godmother. Every means was now
used to convert her back to Catholicism, but at the last she only
yielded on the condition that she need not believe that the soul
of Mme de Villette was lost. Once reconverted, she was neglected
and sent home to live with her mother, who had only a small
pension of 200 livres a year, which ceased on her death in 1650.
The chevalier de Meré, a man of some literary distinction, who
had made her acquaintance at Mme de Neuillant&rsquo;s, discovered
her penniless condition, and introduced his &ldquo;young Indian,&rdquo; as
he called her, to Scarron, the famous wit and comic writer, at
whose house all the literary society of the day assembled. Scarron
took a fancy to the friendless girl, and offered either to pay for
her admission to a convent, or, though he was deformed and an
invalid, to marry her himself. She accepted his offer of marriage,
and became Mme Scarron in 1651. For nine years she was not
only his most faithful nurse, but an attraction to his house,
where she tried to bridle the licence of the conversation of the
time. On the death of Scarron, in 1660, Anne of Austria continued
his pension to his widow, and even increased it to 2000
livres a year, which enabled her to entertain and frequent the
literary society her husband had made her acquainted with; but
on the queen-mother&rsquo;s death in 1666 the king refused to continue
her pension, and she prepared to leave Paris for Lisbon as lady
attendant to the queen of Portugal. But before she started
she met Mme de Montespan, who was already, though not
avowedly, the king&rsquo;s mistress, and who took such a fancy to her
that she obtained the continuance of her pension, which put off
for ever the question of going to Portugal. Mme de Montespan
did yet more for her, for when, in 1669, her first child by the king
was born, Mme Scarron was established with a large income and
a large staff of servants at Vaugirard to bring up the king&rsquo;s
children in secrecy as they were born. In 1674 the king determined
to have his children at court, and their governess, who had
now made sufficient fortune to buy the estate of Maintenon,
accompanied them. The king had now many opportunities of
seeing Mme Scarron, and, though at first he was prejudiced
against her, her even temper contrasted so advantageously with
the storms of passion and jealousy exhibited by Mme de Montespan,
that she grew steadily in his favour, and had in 1678 the
gratification of having her estate at Maintenon raised to a marquisate
and herself entitled Mme de Maintenon by the king. Such
favours brought down the fury of Mme de Montespan&rsquo;s jealousy,
and Mme de Maintenon&rsquo;s position was almost unendurable, until,
in 1680, the king severed their connexion by making the latter
second lady in waiting to the dauphiness, and soon after Mme de
Montespan left the court. The new <i>amie</i> used her influence on
the side of decency, and the queen openly declared she had never
been so well treated as at this time, and eventually died in Mme
de Maintenon&rsquo;s arms in 1683. The queen&rsquo;s death opened the
way to yet greater advancement; in 1684 Mme de Maintenon was
made first lady in waiting to the dauphiness, and in the winter of
1685-1686 she was privately married to the king by Harlay,
archbishop of Paris, in the presence, it is believed, of Père la
Chaise, the king&rsquo;s confessor, the marquis de Montchevreuil, the
chevalier de Forbin, and Bontemps. No written proof of the
marriage is extant, but that it took place is nevertheless certain.
Her life during the next thirty years can be fully studied in her
letters, of which many authentic examples are extant. As a wife
she was wholly admirable; she had to entertain a man who would
not be amused, and had to submit to that terribly strict court
etiquette of absolute obedience to the king&rsquo;s inclination, which
Saint-Simon so vividly describes, and yet be always cheerful
and never complain of weariness or ill-health. Her political
influence has probably been exaggerated, but it was supreme in
matters of detail. The ministers of the day used to discuss and
arrange all the business to be done with the king beforehand with
her, and it was all done in her cabinet and in her presence, but
the king in more important matters often chose not to consult
her. Such mistakes as, for instance, the replacing of Catinat by
Villeroi may be attributed to her, but not whole policies&mdash;notably,
according to Saint-Simon, not the policy with regard to
the Spanish succession. Even the revocation of the edict of Nantes
and the dragonnades have been laid to her charge, but recent
investigations have tended to show that in spite of ardent
Catholicism, she at least opposed, if not very vigorously, the
cruelties of the dragonnades, although she was pleased with the
conversions they procured. She was apparently afraid to imperil
her great reputation for devotion, which had in 1692 obtained for
her from Innocent XII. the right of visitation over all the convents
in France. Where she deserves blame is in her use of her
power for personal patronage, as in compassing the promotions
of Chamillart and Villeroi, and the frequent assistance given to
her brother Comte Charles d&rsquo;Aubigné. Her influence was on
the whole a moderating and prudent force. Her social influence
was not as great as it might have been, owing to her holding no
recognized position at court, but it was always exercised on the
side of decency and morality, and it must not be forgotten that
from her former life she was intimate with the literary people
of the day. Side by side with this public life, which wearied her
with its shadowy power, occasionally crossed by a desire to be
recognised as queen, she passed a nobler and sweeter private
existence as the foundress of St Cyr. Mme de Maintenon was
a born teacher; she had so won the hearts of her first pupils that
they preferred her to their own mother, and was similarly
successful later with the young and impetuous duchess of Burgundy,
and she had always wished to establish a home for poor
girls of good family placed in such straits as she herself had experienced.
As soon as her fortunes began to mend she started a
small home for poor girls at Ruel, which she afterwards moved to
Noisy, and which was the nucleus of the splendid institution of
St Cyr, which the king endowed in 1686, at her request, out of
the funds of the Abbey of St Denis. She was in her element
there. She herself drew up the rules of the institution; she
examined every minute detail; she befriended her pupils in
every way; and her heart often turned from the weariness of
Versailles or of Marly to her &ldquo;little girls&rdquo; at St Cyr. It was for
them that Racine wrote his <i>Esther</i> and his <i>Athalie</i>, and it was
because he managed the affairs of St Cyr well that Michel
Chamillart became controller-general of the finances. The later
years of her power were marked by the promotion of her old
pupils, the children of the king and Mme de Montespan, to high
dignity between the blood royal and the peers of the realm, and
it was doubtless under the influence of her dislike for the duke of
Orleans that the king drew up his will, leaving the personal care
of his successor to the duke of Maine, and hampering the duke of
Orleans by a council of regency. On or even before her husband&rsquo;s
death she retired to St Cyr, and had the chagrin of seeing all her
plans for the advancement of the duke of Maine overthrown by
means of the parliament of Paris. However, the regent Orleans
in no way molested her, but, on the contrary, visited her at St Cyr
and continued her pension of 48,000 livres. She spent her last
years at St Cyr in perfect seclusion, but an object of great interest
to all visitors to France, who, however, with the exception of
Peter the Great, found it impossible to get an audience with her.
On the 15th of April 1719 she died, and was buried in the choir at
St Cyr, bequeathing her estate at Maintenon to her niece, the
only daughter of her brother Charles and wife of the maréchal de
Noailles, to whose family it still belongs.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAINZ<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> (Fr. Mayence) a city, episcopal see and fortress of
Germany, situated on the left bank of the Rhine, almost opposite
the influx of the Main, at the junction of the important main
lines of railway from Cologne to Mannheim and Frankfort-on-Main,
25 m. W. of the latter. Pop. (1905), 91,124 (including a
garrison of 7500 men), of whom two-thirds are Roman Catholic.
The Rhine, which here attains the greatest breadth of its upper
course, is crossed by a magnificent bridge of five arches, leading
to the opposite town of Castel and by two railway bridges.
The old fortifications have recently been pushed farther back,
and their place occupied by pleasant boulevards. The river
front has been converted into a fine promenade, commanding
extensive views of the Taunus range of mountains, and the
&ldquo;Rheingau,&rdquo; the most favoured wine district of Germany.
Alongside the quay are the landing-places of the steamboats
navigating the Rhine. The railway, which formerly incommoded
the bank, has been diverted, and now, following the ceinture of
the new line of inner fortifications, runs into a central station
lying to the south of the city. The interior of the old town
consists chiefly of narrow and irregular streets, with many quaint
and picturesque houses. The principal street of the new town
is the Kaiserstrasse, leading from the railway station to the
river.</p>

<p>The first object of historical and architectural interest in
Mainz is the grand old cathedral, an imposing Romanesque
edifice with numerous Gothic additions and details (for plan, &amp;c.
see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Architecture</a></span>: <i>Romanesque and Gothic in Germany</i>). It
was originally erected between 975 and 1009, but has since been
repeatedly burned down and rebuilt, and in its present form
dates chiefly from the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries. The largest
of its six towers is 300 ft. high. The whole building was restored
by order of Napoleon in 1814, and another thorough renovation
was made more recently. The interior contains the tombs of
Boniface, the first archbishop of Mainz, of Frauenlob, the Minnesinger,
and of many of the electors. Mainz possesses nine other
Roman Catholic churches, the most noteworthy of which are
those of St Ignatius, with a finely painted ceiling, of St Stephen,
built 1257-1328, and restored after an explosion in 1857, and
of St Peter. The old electoral palace (1627-1678), a large building
of red sandstone, now contains a valuable collection of Roman
and Germanic antiquities, a picture gallery, a natural history
museum, the Gutenberg Museum, and a library of 220,000
volumes. Among the other principal buildings are the palace
of the grand duke of Hesse, built in 1731-1739 as a lodge of the
Teutonic order, the theatre, the arsenal, and the government
buildings. A handsome statue of Gutenberg, by Thorwaldsen,
was erected at Mainz in 1837. Mainz still retains many relics
of the Roman period, the most important of which is the
Eigelstein, a monument believed to have been erected by the
Roman legions in honour of Drusus. It stands within the
citadel, which occupies the site of the Roman castrum. A little
to the south-west of the town are the remains of a large Roman
aqueduct, of which upwards of sixty pillars are still standing.
The educational and scientific institutions of Mainz include an
episcopal seminary, two gymnasia and other schools, a society for
literature and art, a musical society, and an antiquarian society.
The university, founded in 1477, was suppressed by the French
in 1798.</p>

<p>The site of Mainz would seem to mark it out naturally as a
great centre of trade, but the illiberal rule of the archbishops and
its military importance seriously hampered its commercial and
industrial development, and prevented it from rivalling its neighbour
Frankfort. It is now, however, the chief emporium of the
Rhenish wine traffic, and also carries on an extensive transit trade
in grain, timber, flour, petroleum, paper and vegetables. The
natural facilities for carriage by water are supplemented by the
extensive railway system. Large new harbours to the north of
the city were opened in 1887. The principal manufactures are
leather goods, furniture, carriages, chemicals, musical instruments
and carpets, for the first two of which the city has attained
a wide reputation. Other industries include brewing and printing.
Mainz is the seat of the administrative and judicial
authorities of the province of Rhein-Hessen, and also of a Roman
Catholic bishop.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Mainz, one of the oldest cities in Germany, was
originally a Celtic settlement. Its strategic importance was
early recognized by the Romans, and about 13 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Drusus, the
son-in-law of Augustus, erected a fortified camp here, to which
the <i>castellum Mattiacorum</i> (the modern Castel) on the opposite
bank was afterwards added, the two being connected with a
bridge at the opening of the Christian era. The Celtic name became
latinized as <i>Maguntiacum</i>, or <i>Moguntiacum</i>, and a town
gradually arose around the camp, which became the capital of
Germania Superior. During the Völkerwanderung Mainz suffered
severely, being destroyed on different occasions by the Alamanni,
the Vandals and the Huns. Christianity seems to have been introduced
into the town at a very early period, and in the 6th century
a new Mainz was founded by Bishop Sidonius. In the middle
of the 8th century under Boniface it became an archbishopric,
and to this the primacy of Germany was soon annexed. Charlemagne,
who had a palace in the neighbourhood, gave privileges to
Mainz, which rose rapidly in wealth and importance, becoming
a free city in 1118. During the later middle ages it was the seat
of several diets, that of 1184 being of unusual size and splendour.
In 1160 the citizens revolted against Archbishop Arnold, and in
1163 the walls of the city were pulled down by order of the
emperor Frederick I. But these events did not retard its progress.
In 1244 certain rights of self-government were given to
the citizens; and in 1254 Mainz was the centre and mainspring
of a powerful league of Rhenish towns. Owing to its commercial
prosperity it was known as <i>goldene</i> Mainz, and its population
is believed to have been as great as it is at the present day. But
soon a decline set in. In 1462 there was warfare between two
rival archbishops, Diether or Dietrich II. of Isenburg (d. 1463)
and Adolph II. of Nassau (d. 1475). The citizens espoused the
cause of Diether, but their city was captured by Adolph; it was
then deprived of its privileges and was made subject to the archbishop.
Many of the inhabitants were driven into exile, and
these carried into other lands a knowledge of the art of printing,
which had been invented at Mainz by Johann Gutenberg in 1450.
During the Thirty Years&rsquo; War Mainz was occupied by the Swedes
in 1631 and by the French in 1644, the fortifications being
strengthened by the former under Gustavus Adolphus; in 1688 it
was captured again by the French, but they were driven out in
the following year. In 1792 the citizens welcomed the ideas of
the French Revolution; they expelled their archbishop, Friedrich
Karl Joseph d&rsquo;Erthal, and opened their gates to the French
troops. Taken and retaken several times during the next few
years, Mainz was ceded to France by the treaty of Campo Formio
in 1797, and again by the Treaty of Lunéville in 1801. In 1814
it was restored to Germany and in 1816 it was handed over to
the grand duke of Hesse; it remained, however, a fortress of the
German confederation and was garrisoned by Prussian and
Austrian troops. Since 1871 it has been a fortress of the German
Empire. There were disturbances in the city in 1848.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Archbishopric of Mainz</span>, one of the seven electorates of
the Holy Roman Empire, became a powerful state during the
middle ages and retained some of its importance until the dissolution
of the empire in 1806. Its archbishop was president of
the electoral college, arch-chancellor of the empire and primate of
Germany. Its origin dates back to 747, when the city of Mainz
was made the seat of an archbishop, and a succession of able
and ambitious prelates, obtaining lands and privileges from
emperors and others, made of the district under their rule a strong
and vigorous state. Among these men were Hatto I. (d. 913),
Siegfried III. of Eppstein (d. 1249), Gerhard of Eppstein
(d. 1305), and Albert of Brandenburg (d. 1545), all of whom
played important parts in the history of Germany. There were
several violent contests between rivals anxious to secure so
splendid a position as the electorate, and the pretensions of the
archbishops occasionally moved the citizens of Mainz to revolt.
The lands of the electorate lay around Mainz, and were on both
banks of the Rhine; their area at the time of the French Revolution
was about 3200 sq. m. The last elector was Karl Theodor
von Dalberg. The archbishopric was secularized in 1803, two
years after the lands on the left bank of the Rhine had been
seized by France. Some of those on the right bank of the river
were given to Prussia and to Hesse; others were formed into a
grand duchy for Dalberg. The archbishopric itself was transferred
to Regensburg.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAIRET, JEAN DE<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> (1604-1686), French dramatist, was born
at Besançon, and baptized on the 10th of May 1604. His own
statement that he was born in 1610 has been disproved. He
went to Paris to study at the Collège des Grassins about 1625,
in which year he produced his first piece <i>Chriséide et Arimand</i>,
followed in 1626 by <i>Sylvie</i>, a &ldquo;pastoral tragi-comedy.&rdquo; In 1634
appeared his masterpiece, <i>Sophonisbe</i>, which marks, in its observance
of the rules, the beginning of the &ldquo;regular&rdquo; tragedies.
Mairet was one of the bitterest assailants of Corneille in the controversy
over <i>The Cid</i>. It was perhaps his jealousy of Corneille
that made him give up writing for the stage. He was appointed
in 1648 official representative of the Franche-Comté in Paris,
but in 1653 he was banished by Mazarin. He was subsequently
allowed to return, but in 1668 he retired to Besançon, where he
died on the 31st of January 1686. His other plays include
<i>Silvanire ou la Morte-vive</i>, published in 1631 with an elaborate
preface on the observance of the unities, <i>Les Galanteries du

count, and is said to have been of Languedocian extraction. The
father of Joseph was president of the senate of Savoy, and held
other important offices. Joseph himself, after studying at Turin,
received various appointments in the civil service of Savoy,
finally becoming a member of the senate. In 1786 he married
Françoise de Morand. The invasion and annexation of Savoy by
the French Republicans made him an exile. He did not take
refuge in that part of the king of Sardinia&rsquo;s domains which was
for the time spared, but betook himself to the as yet neutral
territory of Lausanne. There, in 1796, he published his first
important work (he had previously written certain discourses,
pamphlets, letters, &amp;c.), <i>Considérations sur la France</i>. In this
he developed his views, which were those of a Legitimist, but a
Legitimist entirely from the religious and Roman Catholic point
of view. The philosophism of the 18th century was Joseph de
Maistre&rsquo;s lifelong object of assault.</p>

<p>After the still further losses which, in the year of the publication
of this book, the French Revolution inflicted on Sardinia,
Charles Emmanuel summoned Joseph de Maistre to Turin, and
he remained there for the brief space during which the king
retained a remnant of territory on the mainland. Then he went
to the island of Sardinia, and held office at Cagliari. In 1802 he
was appointed envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary
at St Petersburg, and journeyed thither the next year. Although
his post was no sinecure, its duties were naturally less engrossing
than the official life, with intervals of uneasy exile and travelling,
which he had hitherto known, and his literary activity was great.
He only published a single treatise, on the <i>Principe générateur des
Constitutions</i>; but he wrote his best and most famous works, <i>Du
Pape</i>, <i>De L&rsquo;église gallicane</i> and the <i>Soirées de St Pétersbourg</i>, the
last of which was never finished. <i>Du Pape</i>, which the second-named
book completes, is a treatise in regular form, dealing with
the relations of the sovereign pontiff to the Church, to temporal
sovereigns, to civilization generally, and to schismatics, especially
Anglicans and the Greek Church. It is written from the highest
possible standpoint of papal absolutism. The <i>Soirées de St
Pétersbourg</i>, so far as it is anything (for the arrangement is somewhat
desultory), is a kind of <i>théodicée</i>, dealing with the fortunes
of virtue and vice in this world. It contains two of De Maistre&rsquo;s
most famous pieces, his panegyric on the executioner as the
foundation of social order, and his acrimonious, and in part unfair,
but also in part very damaging, attack on Locke. The <i>Du Pape</i>
is dated May 1817; on the <i>Soirées</i> the author was still engaged
at his death. Besides these works he wrote an examination of
the philosophy of Bacon, some letters on the Inquisition (an
institution which, as may be guessed from the remarks just
noticed about the executioner, was no stumbling-block to him),
and, earlier than any of these, a translation of Plutarch&rsquo;s &ldquo;Essay
on the Delay of Divine Justice,&rdquo; with somewhat copious notes.
After 1815 he returned to Savoy, and was appointed to high office,
while his <i>Du Pape</i> made a great sensation. But the world to
which he had returned was not altogether in accordance with his
desires. He had domestic troubles; and chagrin of one sort and
another is said to have had not a little to do with his death by
paralysis on the 26th of February 1821 at Turin. Most of the
works mentioned were not published till after his death, and it
was not till 1851 that a collection of <i>Lettres et opuscules</i>
appeared, while even since that time fresh matter has been
published.</p>

<p>Joseph de Maistre was one of the most powerful, and by far
the ablest, of the leaders of the neo-Catholic and anti-revolutionary
movement. The most remarkable thing about his standpoint
is that, layman as he was, it was entirely ecclesiastical.
Unlike his contemporary Bonald, Joseph de Maistre regarded
the temporal monarchy as an institution of altogether inferior
importance to the spiritual primacy of the pope. He was by no
means a political absolutist, except in so far as he regarded
obedience as the first of political virtues, and he seldom loses an
opportunity of stipulating for a tempered monarchy. But the
pope&rsquo;s power is not to be tempered at all, either by councils or
by the temporal power or by national churches, least of all by
private judgment. The peculiarity of Joseph de Maistre is that
he supports his conclusions, or if it be preferred his paradoxes,
by the hardest and heaviest argument. Although a great
master of rhetoric, he never makes rhetoric do duty for logic.
Every now and then it is possible to detect fallacies in him, but
for the most part he has succeeded in carrying matters back to
those fundamental differences of opinion which hardly admit of
argument, and on which men take sides in consequence chiefly
of natural bent, and of predilection for one state of things rather
than for another. The absolute necessity of order may be said
to have been the first principle of this thinker, who, in more ways
than one, will invite comparison with Hobbes. He could not
conceive such order without a single visible authority, reference
to which should settle all dispute. He saw that there could be no
such temporal head, and in the pope he thought that he saw a
spiritual substitute. The anarchic tendencies of the Revolution
in politics and religion were what offended him. It ought to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page446" id="page446"></a>446</span>
added that he was profoundly and accurately learned in history
and philosophy, and that the superficial blunders of the 18th-century
<i>philosophes</i> irritated him as much as their doctrines. To
Voltaire in particular he shows no mercy.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Of the two works named as his masterpieces, <i>Du Pape</i> and the
<i>Soirées de St Pétersbourg</i>, editions are extremely numerous. No
complete edition of his works appeared till 1884-1887, when one
was published at Lyons in 14 volumes. This had been preceded,
and has been followed, by numerous biographies and discussions:

<p><span class="bold">MAISTRE, XAVIER DE<a name="ar76" id="ar76"></a></span> (1763-1852), younger brother of
Joseph de Maistre, was born at Chambéry in October 1763. He
served when young in the Piedmontese army, and wrote his
delightful fantasy, <i>Voyage autour de ma chambre</i> (published 1794)
when he was under arrest at Turin in consequence of a duel.
Xavier shared the politics and the loyalty of his brother, and on
the annexation of Savoy to France, he left the service, and took
a commission in the Russian army. He served under Suvarov
in his victorious Austro-Russian campaign and accompanied the
marshal to Russia. He shared the disgrace of his general, and
supported himself for some time in St Petersburg by miniature
painting. But on his brother&rsquo;s arrival in St Petersburg he was
introduced to the minister of marine. He was appointed to
several posts in the capital, but also saw active service, was
wounded in the Caucasus, and attained the rank of major-general.
He married a Russian lady and established himself in his adopted
country, even after the overthrow of Napoleon, and the consequent
restoration of the Piedmontese dynasty. For a time,
however, he lived at Naples, but he returned to St Petersburg
and died there on the 12th of June 1852. He was only once in
Paris (in 1839), when Sainte-Beuve, who has left some pleasant
reminiscences of him, met him. Besides the <i>Voyage</i> already
mentioned, Xavier de Maistre&rsquo;s works (all of which are of very
modest dimensions) are <i>Le Lépreux de la cité d&rsquo;Aoste</i> (1811), a
touching little story of human misfortune; <i>Les Prisonniers du
Caucase</i>, a powerful sketch of Russian character, <i>La Jeune
Sibérienne</i>, and the <i>Expédition nocturne</i>, a sequel to the <i>Voyage
autour de ma chambre</i> (1825). His style is of remarkable ease
and purity.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAITLAND, EDWARD<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> (1824-1897), English humanitarian
writer, was born at Ipswich on the 27th of October 1824, and
was educated at Caius College, Cambridge. The son of Charles
David Maitland, perpetual curate of St James&rsquo;s Chapel, Brighton,
he was intended for the Church, but his religious views did
not permit him to take holy orders. For some years he lived
abroad, first in California and then as a commissioner of Crownlands
in Australia. After his return to England in 1857 he
took up an advanced humanitarian position, and claimed to
have acquired a new sense by which he was able to discern
the spiritual condition of other people. He was associated with
Mrs Anna Kingsford (1846-1888), the lady-doctor and supporter
of vegetarianism and anti-vivisectionism, who, besides being
one of the pioneers of higher education for women, had become
a devotee of mystical theosophy; with her he brought out
<i>Keys of the Creeds</i> (1875), <i>The Perfect Way: or the Finding
of Christ</i> (1882), and founded the Hermetic Society in 1884.
After her death he founded the Esoteric Christian Union in
1891, and wrote her <i>Life and Letters</i> (1896). He died on the
2nd of October 1897.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAITLAND, FREDERIC WILLIAM<a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span> (1850-1906), English
jurist and historian, son of John Gorham Maitland, was born
on the 28th of May 1850, and educated at Eton and Trinity,
Cambridge, being bracketed at the head of the moral sciences
tripos of 1872, and winning a Whewell scholarship for international
law. He was called to the bar (Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn) in
1876, and made himself a thoroughly competent equity lawyer
and conveyancer, but finally devoted himself to comparative
jurisprudence and especially the history of English law. In
1884 he was appointed reader in English law at Cambridge,
and in 1888 became Downing professor of the laws of England.
Though handicapped in his later years by delicate health, his
intellectual grasp and wide knowledge and research gradually
made him famous as a jurist and historian. He edited numerous
volumes for the Selden Society, including <i>Select Pleas for the
Crown, 1200-1225</i>, <i>Select Pleas in Manorial Courts</i> and <i>The
Court Baron</i>; and among his principal works were <i>Gloucester
Pleas</i> (1884), <i>Justice and Police</i> (1885), <i>Bracton&rsquo;s Note-Book</i>
(1887), <i>History of English Law</i> (with Sir F. Pollock, 1895;
new ed. 1898; see also his article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">English Law</a></span> in this encyclopaedia),
<i>Domesday Book and Beyond</i> (1897), <i>Township and
Borough</i> (1898), <i>Canon Law in England</i> (1898), <i>English Law
and the Renaissance</i> (1901), the <i>Life of Leslie Stephen</i> (1906),
besides important contributions to the <i>Cambridge Modern
History</i>, the <i>English Historical Review</i>, the <i>Law Quarterly
Review</i>, <i>Harvard Law Review</i> and other publications. His
writings are marked by vigour and vitality of style, as well
as by the highest qualities of the historian who recreates the
past from the original sources; he had no sympathy with either
legal or historical pedantry; and his death at Grand Canary
on the 19th of December 1906 deprived English law and
letters of one of their most scholarly and most inspiring representatives,
notable alike for sweetness of character, acuteness
in criticism, and wisdom in counsel.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAITLAND, SIR RICHARD<a name="ar79" id="ar79"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Lord Lethington</span>) (1496-1586),
Scottish lawyer, poet, and collector of Scottish verse,
was born in 1496. His father, Sir William Maitland of
Lethington and Thirlestane, fell at Flodden; his mother was
a daughter of George, Lord Seton. He studied law at the
university of St Andrews, and afterwards in Paris. His castle
at Lethington was burnt by the English in 1549. He was
in 1552 one of the commissioners to settle matters with the
English about the debateable lands. About 1561 he seems to
have lost his sight, but this did not render him incapable of
attending to public business, as he was the same year admitted
an ordinary lord of session with the title of Lord Lethington,
and a member of the privy council; and in 1562 he was appointed
keeper of the Great Seal. He resigned this last office in 1567,
in favour of John, prior of Coldingham, his second son, but
he sat on the bench till he attained his eighty-eighth year.
He died on the 20th of March 1586. His eldest son, by his
wife Mary Cranstoun of Crosbie, was William Maitland (<i>q.v.</i>):
his second son, John (<i>c.</i> 1545-1595), was a lord of session,
and was made a lord of parliament in 1590, with the title of
Lord Maitland of Thirlestane, in which he was succeeded by
his son John, also for some time a lord of session, who was
created earl of Lauderdale in 1624. One of Sir Richard&rsquo;s
daughters, Margaret, assisted her father in preparing his
collection of old Scots verse.</p>

<p>The poems of Sir Richard Maitland, none of them lengthy,
are for the most part satirical, and are principally directed
against the social and political abuses of his time. He is chiefly
remembered as the industrial collector and preserver of many
pieces of Scots poetry. These were copied into two large
volumes, one in folio and another in quarto, the former written
by himself, and the latter by his daughter. After being in
the possession of his descendant the duke of Lauderdale, these
volumes were purchased at the sale of the duke&rsquo;s library by
Samuel Pepys, and have since been preserved in the Pepysian
Library, Magdalene College, Cambridge. They lay there unnoticed
for many years till Bishop Percy published one of
the poems in his <i>Reliques of English Poetry</i>. Several of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page447" id="page447"></a>447</span>
prices were then transcribed by John Pinkerton, who afterwards
published them under the title of <i>Ancient Scottish Poems</i>
(2 vols., 1786.)</p>

<p>For an account of the Maitland Folio MS. see Gregory Smith&rsquo;s
<i>Specimens of Middle Scots</i>, 1902 (p. lxxiii.). The Scottish Text
Society has undertaken an edition of the entire manuscript.
Maitland&rsquo;s own poems were reprinted by Sibbald in his <i>Chronicle
of Scottish Poetry</i> (1802), and in 1830 by the Maitland Club, named
after him, and founded for the purpose of continuing his efforts to
preserve the remains of early Scots literature. Sir Richard left in
manuscript a history of the family of Seton, and a volume of legal
decisions collected by him between the years 1550 and 1565. Both
are preserved in the Advocates&rsquo; Library, Edinburgh; the former was
published by the Maitland Club, in 1829.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAITLAND<a name="ar80" id="ar80"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Maitland of Lethington</span>), <span class="bold">WILLIAM</span> (<i>c.</i>
1528-1573), Scottish statesman, eldest son of the preceding,
was educated at St Andrews. At an early age he entered
public life and began in various ways to serve the regent, Mary
of Lorraine, becoming her secretary of state in 1558. In 1559,
however, he deserted her and threw in his lot with the lords
of the congregation, to whom his knowledge of foreign, and
especially of English, politics and his general ability were
assets of the highest value. The lords sent him to England
to ask for assistance from Elizabeth, and his constant aim
throughout his political career was to bring about a union
between the two crowns. He appears to have feared the
return of Mary Queen of Scots to Scotland, but after her
arrival in 1561 he was appointed secretary of state, and for
about six years he directed the policy of Scotland and enjoyed
the confidence of the queen. His principal antagonist was
John Knox; there were several tussles between them, the
most famous, perhaps, being the one in the general assembly
of 1564, and on the whole Maitland held his own against the
preachers. He was doubtless concerned in the conspiracy
against David Rizzio, and after the favourite&rsquo;s murder he
was obliged to leave the court and was himself in danger of
assassination. In 1567, however, he was again at Mary&rsquo;s side.
He was a consenting party to the murder of Darnley, although
he had favoured his marriage with Mary, but the enmity
between Bothwell and himself was one of the reasons which
drove him into the arms of the queen&rsquo;s enemies, among whom
he figured at Langside. He was one of the Scots who met
Elizabeth&rsquo;s representatives at York in 1568; here he showed
a desire to exculpate Mary and to marry her to the duke of
Norfolk, a course of action probably dictated by a desire to
avoid all revelations about the Darnley murder. But this
did not prevent him from being arrested in September 1569
on account of his share in the crime. He was, however, delivered
from his captors by a ruse on the part of his friend, Sir William
Kirkcaldy of Grange, and was brought into Edinburgh Castle,
while his trial was put off because the city was thronged with
his adherents. Maitland now became the leader of the remnant
which stood by the cause of the imprisoned queen. Already
a physical wreck, he was borne into Edinburgh Castle in April
1571 and with Kirkcaldy he held this fortress against the
regent Morton and his English auxiliaries. The castle surrendered
in May 1573 and on the 7th or the 9th of June following
Maitland died at Leith, there being very little evidence for
the theory that he poisoned himself. &ldquo;Secretary Maitland&rdquo;
was a man of great learning with a ready wit and a caustic
tongue. He was reputed to be the most versatile and accomplished
statesman of his age, and almost alone among his
Scottish contemporaries he placed his country above the claims
of either the Roman Catholic or the Protestant religions.
Among the testimonies to his great abilities are those of Queen
Elizabeth, of William Cecil and of Knox. By his second wife,
Mary Fleming, one of Queen Mary&rsquo;s ladies, whom he married
in 1567, he had a son and daughter. His son James died
without issue about 1620.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAITREYA<a name="ar82" id="ar82"></a></span>, the name of the future Buddha. In one of
the works included in the Pali canon, the <i>D&#299;gha Nik&#257;ya</i>, a
prophecy is put into the Buddha&rsquo;s mouth that after the decay
of the religion another Buddha, named Metteyya, will arise
who will have thousands of followers instead of the hundreds
that the historical Buddha had. This is the only mention
of the future Buddha in the canon. For some centuries we
hear nothing more about him. But when, in the period just
before and after the Christian era, some Buddhists began to
write in Sanskrit instead of Pali, they composed new works
in which Maitreya (the Sanskrit form of Metteyya) is more
often mentioned, and details are given as to his birthplace
and history. These are entirely devised in imitation of the
details of the life of the historical Buddha, and have no independent
value. Only the names differ. The document in
which the original prophecy occurs was put together at some
date during the 1st century after the Buddha&rsquo;s death (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Nik&#257;ya</a></span>). It is impossible to say whether tradition was, at
that time, correct in attributing it to the Buddha. But whoever
chose the name (it is a patronymic or family, not a personal
name), had no doubt regard to the etymological connexion
with the word for &ldquo;love,&rdquo; which is Mett&#257; in Pali. This would
only be one of those punning allusions so frequent in Indian
literature.</p>

<p>Long afterwards, probably in the 6th or 7th century, a
reformer in south India, at a time when the incoming flood
of ritualism and superstition threatened to overwhelm the
simple teaching of the earlier Buddhism, wrote a Pali poem,
entitled the <i>An&#257;gata Va&#7747;sa</i>. In this he described the golden
age of the future when, in the time of Metteyya, kings, ministers
and people would vie one with the other in the maintenance
of the original simple doctrine, and in the restoration of the
good times of old. The other side also claimed the authority
of the future Buddha for their innovations. Statues of Maitreya
are found in Buddhist temples, of all sects, at the present
day; and the belief in his future advent is universal among
Buddhists.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAIWAND<a name="ar83" id="ar83"></a></span>, a village of Afghanistan, 50 m. N.W. of Kandahar.
It is chiefly notable for the defeat inflicted on a British
brigade under General Burrows by Ayub Khan on the 27th of
July 1880 during the second Afghan War (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Afghanistan</a></span>).
Ayub Khan, Shere Ali&rsquo;s younger son, who had been holding
Herat during the British operations at Kabul and Kandahar,
set out towards Kandahar with a small army in June 1880, and
a brigade under General Burrows was detached from Kandahar
to oppose him. Burrows advanced to the Helmund, opposite
Girishk, to oppose Ayub Khan, but was there deserted by the
troops of Shere Ali, the wali of Kandahar, and forced to retreat
to Kushk-i-Nakhud, half way to Kandahar. In order to
prevent Ayub passing to Ghazni, Burrows advanced to Maiwand
on the 27th of July, and attacked Ayub, who had already
seized that place. The Afghans, who numbered 25,000, outflanked
the British, the artillery expended their ammunition,
and the native portion of the Brigade got out of hand and
pressed back on the few British infantry. The British were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page448" id="page448"></a>448</span>
completely routed, and had to thank the apathy of the Afghans
for escaping total annihilation. Of the 2476 British troops
engaged, 934 were killed and 175 wounded or missing. This
defeat necessitated Sir Frederick Roberts&rsquo; famous march from
Kabul to Kandahar.</p>

to the description of Theophrastus), a plant of the tribe
Maydeae of the order Gramineae or grasses (see fig. 1). It is
unknown in the native state,
but is most probably indigenous
to tropical America.
Small grains of an unknown
variety have been found in
the ancient tombs of Peru,
and Darwin found heads of
maize embedded on the shore
in Peru at 85 ft. above the
present sea-level. Bonafous,
however (<i>Histoire naturelle
du maïs</i>), quotes authorities
(Bock, 1532, Ruel and Fuchs)
as believing that it came
from Asia, and maize was said
by Santa Rosa de Viterbo to
have been brought by the
Arabs into Spain in the 13th
century. A drawing of maize
is also given by Bonafous from
a Chinese work on natural
history, <i>Li-chi-tchin</i>, dated
1562, a little over sixty years
after the discovery of the New
World. It is not figured on
Egyptian monuments, nor was
any mention made of it by
Eastern travellers in Africa or
Asia prior to the 16th century.
Humboldt, Alphonse de
Candolle and others, however,
do not hesitate to say that it
originated solely in America,
where it had been long and extensively cultivated at the period
of the discovery of the New World; and that is the generally
accepted modern view. Some hold the view that maize
originated from a common Mexican fodder grass, <i>Euchlaena
mexicana</i>, known as Teosinte, a closely allied plant which when
crossed with maize yields a maize-like hybrid.</p>

<p>The plant is monoecious, producing the staminate (male)
flowers in a large feathery panicle at the summit, and the
(female) dense spikes of flowers, or &ldquo;cobs,&rdquo; in the axils of
the leaves below, the long pink styles hanging out like a silken
tassel. They are invested by the sheaths of leaves, much
used in packing oranges in south Europe, and the more delicate
ones for cigarettes in South America. Fig. 2 shows a branch
of the terminal male inflorescence. Fig. 3 is a single spikelet
of the same, containing two florets, with the three stamens of
one only protruded. Fig. 4 is a spike of the female inflorescence,
protected by the sheaths of leaves&mdash;the blades being
also present. Usually the sheaths terminate in a point, the
blades being arrested. Fig. 5 is a spikelet of the female inflorescence,
consisting of two outer glumes, the lower one ciliated,
which enclose two florets&mdash;one (<i>a</i>) barren (sometimes fertile),
consisting of a flowering glume and pale only, and the other (<i>b</i>)
fertile, containing the pistil with elongated style. The mass
of styles from the whole spike is pendulous from the summit
of the sheaths, as in fig. 4. Fig. 6 shows the fruit or grain.
More than three hundred varieties are known, which differ
more among themselves than those of any other cereal. Some
come to maturity in two months, others require seven months;
some are as many feet high as others are inches; some have
kernels eleven times larger than others. They vary similarly
in shape and size of ears, colour of the grain, which may be
white, yellow, purple, striped, &amp;c., and also in physical characters
and chemical composition. Dr E. Lewis Sturtevant,
who has made an extended study of the forms and varieties,
classes into seven groups those grown primarily for the grain,
the distinguishing characters of which are based on the grains
or kernels; there are, in addition, forms of horticultural interest
grown for ornament. Pod corn (var. <i>tunicata</i>) is characterized
by having each kernel enclosed in a husk. Pop corn (var.
<i>everta</i>) has a very large proportion of the &ldquo;endosperm&rdquo;&mdash;the
nutritious matter which with the small embryo makes up the
grain&mdash;of a horny consistency, which causes the grain to pop
when heated, that is to say, the kernel becomes turned inside
out by the explosion of the contained moisture. It is also
characterized by the small size of the grain and ear. Flint
corn (var. <i>indurata</i>) has a starchy endosperm enclosed in a
horny layer of varying thickness in the different varieties.
The colour of the grain is white, yellow, red, blue or variegated.
It is commonly cultivated in Canada and northern United States,
where the seasons are too short for Dent corn, and has been
grown as far north as 50° N. lat. Dent or field corn (var.
<i>indentata</i>) has the starchy endosperm extending to the summit
of the grain, with horny endosperm at the sides. The top of
the grain becomes indented, owing to the drying and shrinkage
of the starchy matter; the character of the indented surface
varies with the height and thickness of the horny endosperm.
This is the form commonly grown in the United States; the
varieties differ widely in the size of the plants and the appearance
of the ear.</p>

<p>The colour of the grain varies greatly, being generally white,
yellow, mottled red, or less commonly red. Soft corn (var.
<i>amylacea</i>) has no horny endosperm, and hence the grains shrink
uniformly. It is cultivated only to a limited extent in the
United States, but seems to have been commonly grown by
the Indians in many localities in North and South America.
Sweet corn (var. <i>saccharata</i>) is characterized by the translucent
horny appearance of the grains and
their more or less wrinkled condition.
It is pre-eminently a garden vegetable,
the ear being used before the
grain hardens, when it is well filled
but soft and milky. It is often cooked
and served in the cob; when canned
it is cut from the cob. Canned sweet
corn is an important article of domestic
commerce in Canada and the
United States. In starchy sweet corn
(var. <i>amylea-saccharata</i>) the grain has the external appearance of
sweet corn, but examination shows the lower half to be starchy,
the upper horny and translucent. A form of flint corn, with
variegated leaves, is grown for ornament under the name <i>Zea
japonica</i> or Japanese striped corn.</p>

<p>Chemical analysis, like common experience, shows that
Indian corn is a very nutritious article of food, being richer
in albuminoids than any other cereals when ripe (calculated
in the dry weight). It can be grown in the tropics from the
level of the sea to a height equal to that of the Pyrenees and
in the south and middle of Europe, but it cannot be grown
in England with any chance of profit, except perhaps as fodder.
Frost kills the plant in all its stages and all its varieties; and
the crop does not flourish well if the nights are cool, no matter
how favourable the other conditions.
Consequently it is the first crop to
disappear as one ascends into the mountain
regions, and comparatively little
is grown west of the great plains of
North America. In Brittany, where it
scarcely ripens the grain, it furnishes a strong crop in the autumn
upon sandy soil where clover and lucerne will yield but a poor
produce. It prefers a deep, rich, warm, dry and mellow soil,
and hence the rich bottoms and fertile prairies of the Mississippi
basin constitute the region of its greatest production. It is
extensively grown throughout India, both for the ripe grain
and for use of the unripe cob as a green vegetable. It is the
most common crop throughout South Africa, where it is known
as mealies, being the staple food of the natives. It is also
largely used for fodder and is an important article of export.</p>

<p>As an article of food maize is one of the most extensively
used grains in the world. Although rich in nitrogenous matter
and fat, it does not make good bread. A mixture of rye and
corn meal, however, makes an excellent coarse bread, formerly
much used in the Atlantic states, and a similar bread is now
the chief coarse bread of Portugal and some parts of Spain.
It is either baked into cakes, called <i>tortilla</i> by the Indians of
Yucatan, or made into a kind of porridge, as in Ireland. When
deprived of the gluten it constitutes oswego, maizena or corn
flour. Maize contains more oil than any other cereal, ranging
from 3.5 to 9.5% in the commercial grain. This is one of
the factors in its value for fattening purposes. In distilling
and some other processes this oil is separated and forms an
article of commerce. When maize is sown, broadcast or closely
planted in drills the ears may not develop at all, but the stalk
is richer in sugar and sweeter; and this is the basis of growing
&ldquo;corn-fodder.&rdquo; The amount of forage that may be produced
in this way is enormous; 50,000 to 80,000 &#8468; of green fodder are
grown per acre, which makes 8000 to 12,000 &#8468; as field-cured.
Sugar and molasses have from time to time been manufactured
from the corn stalks.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAJESTY<a name="ar85" id="ar85"></a></span> (Fr. <i>majesté</i>; Lat. <i>majestas</i>, grandeur, greatness,
from the base <i>mag-</i>, as in <i>magnus</i>, great, <i>major</i>, greater, &amp;c.),
dignity, greatness, a term especially used to express the dignity
and power of a sovereign. This application is to be traced
to the use of <i>majestas</i> in Latin to express the supreme sovereign
dignity of the Roman state, the <i>majestas reipublicae</i> or <i>populi
Romani</i>, hence <i>majestatem laedere</i> or <i>minuere</i>, was to commit
high treason, <i>crimen majestatis</i>. (For the modern law and
usage of <i>laesa majestas, lèse majesté, Majestätsbeleidigung</i>,
see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Treason</a></span>.) From the republic <i>majestas</i> was transferred
to the emperors, and the <i>majestas populi Romani</i> became the
<i>majestas imperii</i>, and <i>augustalis majestas</i> is used as a term
to express the sovereign person of the emperor. Honorius
and Theodosius speak of themselves in the first person as
<i>nostra majestas</i>. The term &ldquo;majesty&rdquo; was strictly confined
in the middle ages to the successors of the Roman emperors
in the West, and at the treaty of Cambrai (1529) it is reserved
for the emperor Charles V. Later the word is used of kings
also, and the distinction is made between imperial majesty
(<i>caesareana majestas</i>) and kingly or royal majesty. From
the 16th century dates the application of &ldquo;Most Christian
and Catholic Majesty&rdquo; to the kings of France, of &ldquo;Catholic
Majesty&rdquo; to the kings of Spain, of &ldquo;Most Faithful Majesty&rdquo;
to the kings of Portugal, and &ldquo;Apostolic Majesty&rdquo; to the
kings of Hungary. In England the use is generally assigned
to the reign of Henry VIII., but it is found, though not in
general usage, earlier; thus the <i>New English Dictionary</i> quotes
from an <i>Address of the Kings Clerks to Henry II.</i> in 1171
(Materials for the History of Archbishop Becket, vii. 471, Rolls
Series, 1885), where the king is styled <i>vestra majestas</i>, and
Selden (<i>Titles of Honour</i>, part i. ch. 7, p. 98, ed. 1672) finds
many early uses in letters to Edward I., in charters of creation
of peers, &amp;c. The fullest form in English usage is &ldquo;His Most
Gracious Majesty&rdquo;; another form is &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s Most Excellent
Majesty,&rdquo; as in the English Prayer-book. &ldquo;His Sacred
Majesty&rdquo; was common in the 17th century; and of this form
Selden says: &ldquo;It is true, I think, that in our memory or the
memory of our fathers, the use of it first began in England.&rdquo;
&ldquo;His Majesty,&rdquo; abbreviated H.M., is now the universal European
use in speaking of any reigning king, and &ldquo;His Imperial
Majesty,&rdquo; H.I.M., of any reigning emperor.</p>

<p>From the particular and very early use of &ldquo;majesty&rdquo; for
the glory and splendour of God, the term has been used in
ecclesiastical art of the representation of God the Father
enthroned in glory, sometimes with the other persons of the
Trinity, and of the Saviour alone, enthroned with an aureole.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAJLÁTH, JÁNOS<a name="ar86" id="ar86"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">John, Count</span> (1786-1855), Hungarian
historian and poet, was born at Pest on the 5th of October 1786.
First educated at home, he subsequently studied philosophy at
Eger (Erlau) and law at Györ (Raab), his father, Count Joseph
Majláth, an Austrian minister of state, eventually obtaining for
him an appointment in the public service. Majláth devoted
himself to historical research and the translation into German
of Magyar folk-tales, and of selections from the works of the best
of his country&rsquo;s native poets. Moreover, as an original lyrical
writer, and as an editor and adapter of old German poems,
Majláth showed considerable talent. During the greater part
of his life he resided either at Pest or Vienna, but a few years
before his death he removed to Munich, where he fell into a
state of destitution and extreme despondency. Seized at last
by a terrible infatuation, he and his daughter Henriette, who had
long been his constant companion and amanuensis, drowned
themselves in the Lake of Starnberg, a few miles south-west of
Munich, on the 3rd of January 1855.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Of his historical works the most important are the <i>Geschichte der
Magyaren</i> (Vienna, 1828-1831, 5 vols.; 2nd ed., Ratisbon, 1852-1853)
and his <i>Geschichte des österreichischen Kaiserstaats</i> (Hamburg,
1834-1850, 5 vols.). Specially noteworthy among his metrical translations
from the Hungarian are the <i>Magyarische Gedichte</i> (Stuttgart and
Tübingen, 1825); and <i>Himfy&rsquo;s auserlesene Liebeslieder</i> (Pest, 1829;
2nd ed., 1831). A valuable contribution to folk-lore appeared in
the <i>Magyarische Sagen, Märchen und Erzählungen</i> (Brünn, 1825;
2nd ed., Stuttgart and Tübingen, 1837, 2 vols.).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAJOLICA<a name="ar87" id="ar87"></a></span>, a name properly applied to a species of Italian
ware in which the body is coated with a tin-enamel, on which
is laid and fired a painted decoration. It is also applied to
similar wares made in imitation of the Italian ware in other
countries. The word in Italian is <i>maiolica</i>. Du Cange (<i>Gloss.
s.v.</i> &ldquo;Majorica&rdquo;) quotes from a chronicle of Verona of 1368,
in which the form <i>majolica</i> occurs for the more usual Latin form
<i>majorica</i>. It has usually been supposed that this type of pottery
was first made in the island of Majorca, but it is more probable
that the name was given by the Italians to the lustred Spanish
ware imported by ships hailing from the Balearic Islands. (See
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ceramics</a></span>: <i>Medieval and Later Italian</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAJOR<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Mair</span>), <span class="bold">JOHN</span> (1470-1550), Scottish theological
and historical writer, was born at the village of Gleghornie,
near North Berwick, Scotland, in the year 1470. He was educated
at the school of Haddington, where John Knox was later
a pupil. After a short period spent at Cambridge (at God&rsquo;s
House, afterwards Christ&rsquo;s College) he entered the university of
Paris in 1493, studying successively at the colleges of St Barbe,
Montaigu and Navarre, and graduating as master of arts in 1496.
Promoted to the doctorate in 1505, he lectured on philosophy
at Montaigu College and on theology at Navarre. He visited
Scotland in 1515 and returned in 1518, when he was appointed
principal regent in the university of Glasgow, John Knox being
among the number of those who attended his lectures there.
In 1522 he removed to St Andrew&rsquo;s University, where in 1525
George Buchanan was one of his pupils. He returned to the
college of Montaigu in 1525, but was once more at St Andrew&rsquo;s
in 1531, where he was head of St Salvator&rsquo;s College from 1534
until his death.</p>

<p>Major&rsquo;s voluminous writings may be grouped under (<i>a</i>) logic
and philosophy, (<i>b</i>) Scripture commentary, and (<i>c</i>) history. All
are in Latin, all appeared between 1503 and 1530, and all were
printed at Paris. The first group includes his <i>Exponabilia</i>
(1503), his commentary on Petrus Hispanus (1505-1506), his
<i>Inclitarum artium libri</i> (1506, &amp;c.), his commentary on Joannes
Dorp (1504, &amp;c.), his <i>Insolubilia</i> (1516, &amp;c.), his introduction
to Aristotle&rsquo;s logic (1521, &amp;c.), his commentary on the ethics
(1530), and, chief of all, his commentary on Peter Lombard&rsquo;s
<i>Sentences</i> (1509, &amp;c.); the second consists of a commentary on
Matthew (1518) and another on the Four Gospels (1529); the
last is represented by his famous <i>Historia Majoris Britanniae tam
Angliae quam Scotiae per J. M.</i> (1521). In political philosophy
he maintained the Scotist position, that civil authority was
derived from the popular will, but in theology he was a scholastic
conservative, though he never failed to show his approbation
of Gallicanism and its plea for the reform of ecclesiastical
abuses. He has left on record that it was his aim and hope to
reconcile realism and nominalism in the interests of theological
peace. He had a world-wide reputation as a teacher and writer.
Buchanan&rsquo;s severe epigram, perhaps the only unfriendly words
in the flood of contemporary praise, may be explained as a
protest against the compromise which Major appeared to offer
rather than as a personal attack on his teacher. Major takes
a more independent attitude in his <i>History</i>, which is a remarkable
example of historical accuracy and insight. He claims
that the historian&rsquo;s chief duty is to write truthfully, and he
is careful to show that a theologian may fulfil this condition.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The <i>History</i>, on which his fame now rests, was reprinted by Freebairn
(Edinburgh, 1740), and was translated in 1892 by Archibald
Constable for the Scottish History Society. The latter volume
contains a full account of the author by Aeneas J. G. Mackay and a
bibliography by Thomas Graves Law.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAJOR<a name="ar89" id="ar89"></a></span> (Lat. for &ldquo;greater&rdquo;), a word used, both as a substantive
and adjective, for that which is greater than another in
size, quality, degree, importance, &amp;c., often opposed correlatively
to that to which &ldquo;minor&rdquo; is applied in the same connotation.
In the categorical syllogism in logic, the major term is the term
which forms the predicate of the conclusion, the major premise
is that which contains the major term. (For the distinction
between major and minor intervals, and other applications in
music, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Music</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Harmony</a></span>.)</p>

<p>The use of <i>Major</i> as part of an official title in Med. Lat.
has given the Span. <i>mayor</i>, Fr. <i>maire</i>, and Eng. &ldquo;<i>mayor</i>&rdquo;
(<i>q.v.</i>). In English the unadapted form &ldquo;major&rdquo; is the title of
a military officer now ranking between a captain and a lieutenant-colonel.
Originally the word was used adjectivally in the title
&ldquo;sergeant-major,&rdquo; an officer of high rank (third in command of
an army) who performed the same duties of administration, drill
and encampments on the staff of the chief commander as the
sergeant in a company performs as assistant to the captain. This
was in the latter half of the 16th century, and very soon afterwards
the &ldquo;sergeant-major&rdquo; became known as the &ldquo;sergeant-major-general&rdquo;&mdash;hence
the modern title of major-general. By
the time of the English Civil War &ldquo;majors&rdquo; had been introduced
in each regiment of foot, who corresponded in a lesser sphere
to the &ldquo;major-general&rdquo; of the whole army. The major&rsquo;s
sphere of duties, precedence and title have since varied but little,
though he has, in the British service, taken the place of the
lieutenant-colonel as second in command&mdash;the latter officer
exercising the command of the cavalry regiment, infantry
battalion or artillery brigade, and the colonel being, save for
certain administrative functions, little more than the titular
chief of his regiment. Junior majors command companies of
infantry; squadrons of cavalry and batteries of artillery are also
commanded by majors. In most European armies, however,
and of late years in the army of the United States also, the
major has become a battalion commander under the orders of a
regimental commander (colonel or lieutenant-colonel). The word
appears also in the British service in &ldquo;brigade-major&rdquo; (the
adjutant or staff officer of a brigade). &ldquo;Town-majors&rdquo;
(garrison staff officers) are now no longer appointed. In the
French service up to 1871 the &ldquo;major-general&rdquo; was the chief
of the general staff of a field army, and thus preserved the
tradition of the former &ldquo;sergeant-major&rdquo; or &ldquo;sergeant-major-general.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAJORCA<a name="ar90" id="ar90"></a></span> (<i>Mallorca</i>), the largest of the group of Spanish
islands in the Mediterranean Sea known as the Balearic Islands
(<i>q.v.</i>). Pop. (1900), 248,191; area, 430 sq. m. Majorca has the
shape of a trapezoid, with the angles directed to the cardinal
points; and its diagonal, from Cape Grozer in the west to Cape
Pera in the east, is about 60 m. On the north-west the coast
is precipitous, but on the other sides it is low and sloping. On
the north-east there are several considerable bays, of which
the chief are those of Alcudia and Pollensa; while on the south-west
is the still more important bay of Palma. No fewer than
twelve ports or harbours are enumerated round the island,
of which may be mentioned Andraitx and Sóller. In the north-west
Majorca is traversed by a chain of mountains running
parallel with the coast, and attaining its highest elevation in
Silla de Torrellas (5154 ft.). Towards the south and east the
surface is comparatively level, though broken by isolated peaks
of considerable height. The northern mountains afford great
protection to the rest of the island from the violent gales to which
it would otherwise be exposed, and render the climate remarkably
mild and pleasant. The scenery of Majorca has all the picturesqueness
of outline that usually belongs to a limestone formation.
Some of the valleys, such as those of Valdemosa and Sóller,
with their luxuriant vegetation, are delightful resorts. There
are quarries of marble of various grains and colours&mdash;those near
Santañy, in the district of Manacor, being especially celebrated;
while lead, iron and cinnabar have also been obtained. Coal of a
jet-like character is found at Benisalem, where it was first worked
in 1836; at Selva, where it has been mined since 1851; near
Santa Maria and elsewhere. It is used in the industrial establishments
of Palma, and in the manufacture of lime, plaster and
bricks near the mines. A considerable quantity is also exported
to Barcelona.</p>

<p>The inhabitants are principally devoted to agriculture, and
most of the arable land is cultivated. The mountains are terraced;
and the old pine woods have in many places given way
to the olive, the vine and the almond tree, to fields of wheat and
flax, or to orchards of figs and oranges. For the last-mentioned
fruits the valley of Sóller is one of the most important districts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page451" id="page451"></a>451</span>
the produce being largely transmitted to France. The yield
of oil is very considerable, and Inca is the centre of the oil district.
The wines are light but excellent, especially the Muscadel
and Montona. During the summer there is often great scarcity
of water; but, according to a system handed down by the Moors,
the rains of autumn and winter are collected in enormous
reservoirs, which contain sufficient water to last through the
dry season; and on the payment of a certain rate, each landholder
has his fields flooded at certain intervals. Mules are used
in the agriculture and traffic of the island. The cattle are small,
but the sheep are large and well fleeced. Pigs are reared for
export to Barcelona, and there is abundance of poultry and small
game. Brandy is made and exported in large quantities.
Excellent woollen and linen cloths are woven; the silkworm
is reared and its produce manufactured; and canvas,
rope and cord are largely made, from both native and foreign
materials.</p>

<p>The roads are excellent, the four principal being those from
Alcudia, Manacor, Sóller and Andraitx to the capital. Forty-eight

<p><span class="bold">MAJORIAN<a name="ar91" id="ar91"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Julius Valerius Majorianus</span>), emperor of the
West from 457 to 461. He had distinguished himself as a
general by victories over the Franks and Alemanni, and six
months after the deposition of Avitus he was declared emperor
by the regent Ricimer. After repelling an attack by the Vandals
upon Campania (458) he prepared a large force, composed chiefly
of barbarians, to invade Africa, which he previously visited in
disguise. Having during his stay in Gaul defeated and concluded
an alliance with Theodoric the Visigoth, at the beginning of 460
he crossed the Pyrenees for the purpose of joining the powerful
fleet which he had collected at Carthagena. The Vandal king
Genseric, however, after all overtures of peace had been rejected,
succeeded through the treachery of certain officers in surprising
the Roman fleet, most of the ships being either taken or destroyed.
Majorian thereupon made peace with Genseric. But
his ill-success had destroyed his military reputation; his efforts
to put down abuses and improve the condition of the people had
roused the hatred of the officials; and Ricimer, jealous of his
fame and influence, stirred up the foreign troops against him. A
mutiny broke out in Lombardy, and on the 2nd of August 461
Majorian was forced to resign. He died five days afterwards,
either of dysentery or by violence. Majorian was the author of
a number of remarkable laws, contained in the Theodosian
Code. He remitted all arrears of taxes, the collection of which
was for the future placed in the hands of the local officials. He
revived the institution of <i>defensores</i>, defenders of cities, whose
duty it was to protect the poor and inform the emperor of abuses
committed in his name. The practice of pulling down the ancient
monuments to be used as building material, which was connived
at by venal officials, was strictly prohibited. He also passed
laws against compulsory ordination and premature vows of
celibacy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAKART, HANS<a name="ar96" id="ar96"></a></span> (1840-1884), Austrian painter, born at
Salzburg, was the son of an inspector of the imperial castle.
He has been aptly called the first German <i>painter</i> of the 19th
century. When he, as a youth, entered the Vienna Academy
German art was under the rule of Cornelius&rsquo;s cold classicism.
It was entirely intellectual and academic. Clear and precise
drawing, sculpturesque modelling, and pictorial erudition were
the qualities most esteemed; and it is not surprising that Makart,
poor draughtsman to the very last, with a passionate and sensual
love of colour, and ever impatient to escape the routine of art-school
drawing, was found to be &ldquo;devoid of all talent&rdquo; and
forced to leave the Vienna Academy. He went to Munich, and
after two years of independent study attracted the attention of
Piloty, under whose guidance he made rapid and astonishing
progress. The first picture he painted under Piloty, &ldquo;Lavoisier
in Prison,&rdquo; though timid and conventional, attracted attention
by its sense of colour. In the next, &ldquo;The Knight and the Water
Nymphs,&rdquo; he first displayed the decorative qualities to which he
afterwards sacrificed everything else in his work. With the
&ldquo;Cupids&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Plague in Florence&rdquo; of the next year
his fame became firmly established. &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; was
soon after bought by the Austrian emperor for the Vienna
Museum, and Makart was invited to come to Vienna, where a
large studio was placed at his disposal. In Vienna Makart
became the acknowledged leader of the artistic life of the city,
which in the &rsquo;seventies passed through a period of feverish
activity, the chief results of which are the sumptuously decorated
public buildings of the Ringstrasse.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm of the time, the splendour of the fêtes over
which Makart presided, and the very obvious appeal of his huge
compositions in their glowing richness of colour, in which he tried
to emulate Rubens, made him appear a very giant to his contemporaries
in Vienna, and indeed in all Austria and Germany.
The appearance of each of his ambitious historical and allegorical
paintings was hailed with enthusiasm&mdash;the &ldquo;Catherina Cornaro,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Diana&rsquo;s Hunt,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Entry of Charles V. into Antwerp,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Abundantia,&rdquo; &ldquo;Spring,&rdquo; &ldquo;Summer,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Death of Cleopatra&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Five Senses.&rdquo; He reached the zenith of his
fame when, in 1879, he designed, single-handed, the costumes,
scenic setting, and triumphal cars of the grand pageant with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page452" id="page452"></a>452</span>
which the citizens of Vienna celebrated the silver wedding of
their rulers. Some 15,000 people participated in the pageant,
all dressed in the costumes of the Rubens and Rembrandt period.
Makart died in Vienna in October 1884.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Unfortunately Makart was in the habit of using such villainous
pigments and mediums that in the few decades which have passed
since his death, the vast majority of his large paintings have practically
perished. The blues have turned into green; the bitumen has
eaten away the rich glow of the colour harmonies; the thickly applied
paint has cracked and in some instances crumbled away. And this
loss of their chief quality has accentuated the weaknesses of these
pictures&mdash;the faulty drawing, careless and hasty execution, lack of
deeper significance and prevalence of glaring anachronisms. Important
examples of his work are to be found at the galleries of Vienna,
Berlin, Hamburg and Stuttgart. For the Vienna Museum he also
executed a series of decorative lunettes.</p>

situated near the right bank of the Maros, and is a typical
Hungarian town of the Alföld. The most noteworthy building
is the palace of the bishop of Csanád, whose usual residence is
in Temesvár. The town possesses numerous mills, and the

<p><span class="bold">MAKRAN,<a name="ar99" id="ar99"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Mekran</span>, a province of Baluchistan, fringing the
Arabian Sea from Persia almost to Sind for about 200 m. It is
subject to the khan of Kalat under British political supervision.
Estimated area, 26,000 sq. m.; estimated pop. (1903), 78,000.
The long lateral valley of Kej is usually associated with Makran
in early geographical records. The Kej-Macoran of Marco
Polo is the Makran of to-day.</p>

<p>The long stretch of sandy foreshore is broken on the coast-line
by the magnificent cliffs of Malan, the hammer-shaped
headlands of Ormarah and Gwadar, and the precipitous cliffs of
Jebel Zarain, near Pasni. Within them lies the usual frontier band
of parallel ridges, alternating with narrow valleys. Amongst
them the ranges called Talana and Talur are conspicuous by
their height and regular configuration. The normal conformation
of the Baluchistan frontier is somewhat emphasized in Makran.
Here the volcanic action, which preceded the general upheaval
of recent strata and the folding of the edges of the interior
highlands, is still in evidence in occasional boiling mud volcanoes
on the coast-line. It is repeated in the blazing summit of the
Kuh-i-taftan (the burning mountain of the Persian frontier) which
is the highest active volcano in Asia (13,000 ft.), and probably
the farthest inland. Evidence of extinct mud volcanoes exists
through a very wide area in Baluchistan and Seistan. Probably
the <i>miri</i>, or fort, at Quetta represents one of them. The coast
is indented by several harbours. Ormarah, Khor Kalmat, Pasni
and Gwadar are all somewhat difficult of approach by reason
of a sand-bar which appears to extend along the whole coast-line,
and which is very possibly the last evidence of a submerged
ridge; and they are all subject to a very lively surf under certain
conditions of wind. Of these the port of Gwadar (which belongs
to Muscat and is therefore foreign territory) is the most important.
They all are (or were) stations of the Indo-Persian telegraph
system which unites Karachi with Bushire. With the exception
of the Kej valley, and that of the Bolida, which is an affluent of
the Kej, there are no considerable spaces of cultivation in
Makran. These two valleys seem to concentrate the whole
agricultural wealth of the country. They are picturesque, with
thick groves of date palms at intervals, and are filled with crops
and orchards. They are indeed exceedingly beautiful; and yet
the surrounding waste of hills is chiefly a barren repetition of
sun-cracked crags and ridges with parched and withered valleys
intersecting them, where a trickle of salt water leaves a white and
leprous streak amongst the faded tamarisk or the yellow stalks of
last season&rsquo;s grass. Makran is the home of remnants of an innumerable
company of mixed people gathered from the four
corners of Asia and eastern Africa. The ancient Dravidians, of
whom the Brahui is typical, still exist in many of the districts
which are assigned to them in Herodotus. Amongst them there
is always a prominent Arab element, for the Arabs held Makran
even before they conquered Sind and made the Kej valley their
trade highway to India. There are negroes on the coast, bred
from imported slaves. The Meds of the Indus valley still form
the greater part of the fishing population, representing the
Ichthyophagi of Arrian. The old Tajik element of Persia is not
so evident in Makran as it is farther north; and the Karak
pirates whose depredations led to the invasion of India and the
conquest of Sind, seem to have disappeared altogether. The
fourth section includes the valleys formed by the Raksh&#257;n and
Mashkel, which, sweeping downwards from the Kalat highlands
and the Persian border east and west, unite to break through the
intervening chain of hills northward to form the Mashkel
swamps, and define the northern limits of Makran. In these
valleys are narrow strips of very advanced cultivation, the dates
of Panjgur being generally reckoned superior even to those of
the Euphrates. The great Mashkel swamp and the Kharan
desert to the east of it, mark the flat phase of southern Baluchistan
topography. It is geologically part of an ancient inland
lake or sea which included the present swamp regions of the
Helmund, but not the central depression of the Lora. The latter
is buttressed against hills at a much higher elevation than the
Kharan desert, which is separated from the great expanse of the
Helmund desert within the borders of Afghanistan by a transverse
band of serrated hills forming a distinct watershed from
Nushki to Seistan. Here and there these jagged peaks appear
as if half overwhelmed by an advancing sea of sand. They are
treeless and barren, and water is but rarely found at the edges
of their foothills. The Koh-i-Sultan, at the western extremity
of the northern group of these irregular hills, is over 6000 ft.
above sea-level, but the general level of the surrounding deserts
is only about 2000 ft., sinking to 1500 ft. in the Mashkel Hamun
and the Gaod-i-Zirreh.</p>

<p>The whole of this country has been surveyed by Indian surveyors
and the boundary between Persian and British Baluchistan
was demarcated by a commission in 1895-1896. In 1898 a
column of British troops under Colonel Mayne was despatched
to Makran by sea, owing to a rebellion against the authority
of the khan of Kalat, and an attack made by some Makran
chiefs on a British survey party. The campaign was short and
terminated with the capture of the Kej citadel. Another similar
expedition was required in 1901 to storm the fort at Nodiz.
The headquarters of the native governor, under the khan of
Kalat, are at Turbat, with deputies at Tump, Kolwa, Pasni and
Panjgur. A levy corps, with two British officers, is stationed
along the western frontier. The port of Gwadur forms an
enclave belonging to the sultan of Muscat.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALABAR,<a name="ar101" id="ar101"></a></span> a district of British India, in the Madras Presidency.
Geographically the name is sometimes extended to the
entire western coast of the peninsula. Properly it should
apply to the strip below the Gh&#257;ts, which is inhabited by people
speaking the Malayalam language, a branch of the Dravidian
stock, who form a peculiar race, with castes, customs and
traditions of their own. It would thus be coextensive with
the old kingdom of Chera, including the modern states of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page453" id="page453"></a>453</span>
Travancore and Cochin, and part of Kanara. In 1901 the
total number of persons speaking Malayalam in all India was
6,029,304.</p>

<p>The district of Malabar extends for 145 m. along the coast,
running inland to the Gh&#257;ts with a breadth varying from
70 to 25 m. The administrative headquarters are at Calicut.
Area, 5795 sq. m. Malabar is singularly diversified in its
configuration; from the eastward, the great range of the Western
Gh&#257;ts, only interrupted by the Palgh&#257;t gap, looks down on a
country broken by long spurs, extensive ravines, dense forests
and tangled jungle. To the westward, gentler slopes and downs,
and gradually widening valleys closely cultivated, succeed the
forest uplands, till, nearer the seaboard, the low laterite table-lands
shelve into rice plains and backwaters fringed with coco-nut
palms. The coast runs in a south-easterly direction, and
forms a few headlands and small bays, with a natural harbour
in the south at Cochin. In the south there is considerable
extent of table-land. The mountains of the Western Gh&#257;ts run
almost parallel to the coast, and vary from 3000 to 7000 ft.
in height. One of the most characteristic features of Malabar
is an all but continuous chain of lagoons or backwaters lying
parallel to the coast, which have been formed by the action
of the waves and shore currents in obstructing the waters of
the rivers. Connected by artificial canals, they form a cheap
means of transit; and a large local trade is carried on by inland
navigation. Fishing and fishcuring is an important industry.
The forests are extensive and of great value, but they are almost
entirely private property. The few tracts which are conserved
have come into government hands by escheat or by contract.
Wild animals include the elephant, tiger, panther, bison,
<i>sambhar</i>, spotted deer, N&#299;lgiri ibex, and bear. The population
in 1901 was 2,800,555, showing an increase of 5.6% in the
decade.</p>

<p>The staple crop is rice, the next most important product
being coco-nuts. Coffee is grown chiefly in the upland tract
known as the Wynaad, where there are also a few acres under
tea. The Madras railway crosses the district and has been
extended from Calicut to Cannanore along the coast. There
are eleven seaports, of which the principal are Calicut, Tellicherry,
Cannanore and Cochin. The principal exports are coffee,
coco-nut products and timber. There are factories for cleaning
coffee, pressing coir and making matting, making tiles, sawing
timber and weaving cotton.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALABARI, BEHRAMJI<a name="ar102" id="ar102"></a></span> (1853-&emsp;&emsp;), Indian journalist and
social reformer, was born in 1853 at Baroda, the son of a
poor Parsi in the employment of the state, who died shortly
after his birth. His mother took him to Surat, where he was
educated in a mission school, but he never succeeded in gaining
an academical degree. Coming to Bombay, he fell under the
influence of Dr John Wilson, principal of the Scottish College.
As early as 1875 he published a volume of poems in Gujarati,
followed in 1877 by <i>The Indian Muse in English Garb</i>, which
attracted attention in England, notably from Tennyson, Max
Müller, and Florence Nightingale. His life work began in
1880 when he acquired the <i>Indian Spectator</i>, which he edited
for twenty years until it was merged in the <i>Voice of India</i>.
In 1901 he became editor of <i>East and West</i>. Always holding
aloof from politics, he was an ardent and indefatigable advocate
of social reform in India, especially as regards child marriage
and the remarriage of widows. It was largely by his efforts,
both in the press and in tours through the country, that the Age
of Consent Act was passed in 1891. His account of his visits
to England, entitled <i>The Indian Eye on English Life</i> (1893),
passed through three editions, and an earlier book of a somewhat
satirical nature, <i>Gujarat and the Gujaratis</i> (1883), was equally
popular.</p>

around and behind it forms one of the Straits Settlements, and
gives its name to the Straits which divide Sumatra from the

<i>m&#277;l&#257;ka</i>, is that of a species of jungle fruit, and is also borne
by the small river on the right bank of which the old Dutch
town stands. The Dutch town is connected by a bridge with
the business quarter on the left bank, which is inhabited almost
exclusively by Chinese, Eurasians and Malays.</p>

<p>Malacca, now a somnolent little town, a favourite resort of
rich Chinese who have retired from business, is visited by few
ships and is the least important of the three British settlements
on the Straits which give their name to the colony. It has,
however, a remarkable history. The precise date of its
foundation cannot be ascertained, but there is strong reason
to believe that this event took place at the earliest in the 14th
century. The Roman youth Ludovigo Barthema is believed to
have been the first European to visit it, some time before 1503;
and in 1509 Diogo Lopez de Siqueira sailed from Portugal for
the express purpose of exploiting Malacca. At first he was
hospitably received, but disagreements with the natives ensued
and word was brought to Siqueira by Magellan, who was one
of his company, that a treacherous attack was about to be made
upon his ships. Siqueira then sent a native man and woman
ashore &ldquo;with an arrow passed through their skulls&rdquo; to the
sultan, &ldquo;who was thus informed,&rdquo; says de Barros, &ldquo;through
his subjects that unless he kept a good watch the treason which
he had perpetrated would be punished with fire and sword.&rdquo;
The sultan retaliated by arresting Ruy de Araujo, the factor,
and twenty other men who were ashore with him collecting
cargo for the ships. Siqueira immediately burned one of his
vessels and sailed direct for Portugal. In 1510 Mendez de
Vasconcellos with a fleet of four ships set out from Portugal
&ldquo;to go and conquer Malacca,&rdquo; but d&rsquo;Alboquerque detained
him at Goa, and it was not until 1511 that d&rsquo;Alboquerque himself
found time to visit Malacca and seek to rescue the Portuguese
prisoners who all this time had remained in the hands of the
sultan. An attack was delivered by d&rsquo;Alboquerque on the
25th of July 1511, but it was only partially successful, and it
was not until the 4th of August, when the assault was repeated,
that the place finally fell. Since that time Malacca has continued
to be the possession of one or another of the European Powers.
It was a Portuguese possession for 130 years, and was the headquarters
of their trade and the base of their commercial explorations
in south-eastern Asia while they enjoyed, and later while
they sought to hold, their monopoly in the East. It was from
Malacca, immediately after its conquest, that d&rsquo;Alboquerque
sent d&rsquo;Abreu on his voyage of discovery to the Moluccas, or
Spice Islands, which later were the objective of Magellan&rsquo;s
voyage of circumnavigation. During the Portuguese tenure of
Malacca the place was attacked at least twice by the Achinese;
its shipping was harried by Lancaster in 1592, when the first
British fleet made its way into these seas; it was besieged by
the Dutch in 1606, and finally fell to a joint attack of the Dutch
and the Achinese in 1641. It was under the Portuguese government
that St Francis Xavier started a mission in Malacca, the
first Christian mission in Malayan lands.</p>

<p>The Dutch held Malacca till 1795, when it was taken from
them by Great Britain, and the Dutch system of monopoly in
the straits was forthwith abolished. The colony was restored
to the Dutch, however, in 1818, but six years later it came
finally into the hands of Great Britain, being exchanged by a
treaty with Holland for the East India Company&rsquo;s settlement
of Benkulen and a few other unimportant places on the western
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page454" id="page454"></a>454</span>
coast of Sumatra. By this treaty the Dutch were precluded
from interference in the affairs of the Malay Peninsula, and
Great Britain from similar action in regard to the States of
Sumatra, with the sole exception of Achin, the right to protect
that state being maintained by Great Britain until 1872 when it
was finally abandoned by a treaty concluded with Holland
in that year. The Dutch took advantage of this immediately
to invade Achin, and the strife begun in 1873 still continues
and is now a mere war of extermination. It was not until
1833 that the whole territory lying at the back of Malacca was
finally brought under British control, and as late as 1887 the
Negri Sembilan, or Nine States, which adjoin Malacca territory
on the east and north-east, were completely independent. They
to-day form part of the Federated Malay States, which are under
the protection of Great Britain, and are governed with the
assistance and by the advice of British officers.</p>

<p>Malacca, in common with the rest of the Straits Settlements,
was administered by the government of India until 1867,
when it became a crown colony under the control of the Colonial
Office. It is to-day administered by a resident councillor,
who is responsible to the governor of the Straits Settlements,
and by a number of district officers and other officials under
his direction. The population of the town and territory of
Malacca in 1901 was 94,487, of whom 74 were Europeans and
Americans, 1598 were Eurasians, the rest being Asiatics (chiefly
Malays with a considerable sprinkling of Chinese). The population
in 1891 was 92,170, and the estimated population for 1905
was 97,000. The birth-rate is about 35 per thousand, and the
death-rate about 29 per thousand. The trade of this once
flourishing port has declined, most of the vessels being merely
coasting craft, and no large line of steamers holding any communication
with the place. This is due partly to the shallowness
of the harbour, and partly to the fact that the ports of Penang
and Singapore, at either entrance to the straits, draw all the trade
and shipping to themselves. The total area of the settlement
is about 700 sq. m. The colony is wholly agricultural, and the
land is almost entirely in the hands of the natives. About 50,000
acres are under tapioca, and about 9000 acres are under rubber
(<i>hevea</i>). This cultivation is rapidly extending. There are still
considerable areas unoccupied which are suitable for rubber and
for coco-nuts. The settlement is well opened up by roads;
and a railway, which is part of the Federated Malay States
railway system, has been constructed from the town of Malacca
to Tampin in the Negri Sembilan. There is a good rest-house
at Malacca and a comfortable seaside bungalow at Tanjong Kling,
seven miles from the town. Malacca is 118 m. by sea from Singapore
and 50 m. by rail from Seremban, the capital of the Negri
Sembilan. There is excellent snipe-shooting to be had in the
vicinity of Malacca.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALACHI,<a name="ar105" id="ar105"></a></span> the name assigned to the last book of the Old
Testament in English (the last of the &ldquo;prophets&rdquo; in the Hebrew
Bible), which according to the title (Mal. i. 1) contains the
&ldquo;word of Yahweh to Israel by the hand of Malachi.&rdquo; In form
the word means &ldquo;my messenger.&rdquo; It could be explained as
a contraction of Malachiah, &ldquo;messenger of Yahweh&rdquo;; but the
Septuagint is probably right in not regarding it as a proper
name (&ldquo;by the hand of His messenger&rdquo;). Not only do we
know nothing from internal or external evidence of the existence
of a prophet of this name,<a name="fa1i" id="fa1i" href="#ft1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a> but the occurrence of the word in
the title is naturally explained as derived from iii. 1: &ldquo;Behold,
I send my messenger&rdquo; (cf. ii. 7). The prophecy must, therefore,
be regarded as anonymous; the title was added by the compiler
who wrote similar editorial titles to the anonymous prophecies
beginning Zech. ix. 1, xii. 1.</p>

<p>The contents of the prophecy fall into a series of clearly marked
sections, as in the paragraph division of the Revised Version.
These apply, in various ways, the truth emphasized at the
outset: Yahweh&rsquo;s love for Israel in contrast with his treatment
of Edom (i. 2-5). Israel&rsquo;s response should be a proper regard
for the ritual of His worship; yet any offering, however imperfect,
is thought good enough for Yahweh&rsquo;s altar (i. 6-14). Let the
priests, who are responsible, take warning, and return to their
ancient ideals (ii. 1-9). Again, the common Fatherhood of God
should inspire a right relation among fellow Israelites, not
such conduct as the divorce of Israelite wives in order to marry
non-Israelite women (ii. 10-16).<a name="fa2i" id="fa2i" href="#ft2i"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The prevalence of wrong-doing
has provoked scepticism as to righteous judgment; but the
messenger of Yahweh is at hand to purge away indifferentism
from worship and immorality from conduct (ii. 17-iii. 6). The
payment of tithes now withheld will be followed by the return
of prosperity (iii. 7-12). Religion may seem useless, but
Yahweh remembers His own, and will soon in open judgment
distinguish them from the irreligious (iii. 13-iv. 3). The book
closes with an appeal to observe the law of Moses, and
with a promise that Elijah shall come before the threatened
judgment.<a name="fa3i" id="fa3i" href="#ft3i"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>The topics noticed clearly relate the prophecy to the period
of Ezra and Nehemiah, when the Temple had been rebuilt
(i. 10; iii. 1, 10), the province of Judah was under a Persian
governor (i. 8), and there had been time enough for the loss of
earlier enthusiasm. The majority of modern scholars are agreed
that the prophet prepares for the work of those reformers (Ezra,
458; Nehemiah, 444, 432 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). The abuses of which he particularly
complains are such as were found rampant by Ezra and
Nehemiah&mdash;marriage with foreign women (ii. 11; cf. Ezra ix.;
Neh. xiii. 23 seq.; Deut. vii. 3) and failure in payment of sacred
dues (iii. 8 seq.; cf. Neh. x. 34 seq.; xiii. 10 seq.; Deut. xxvi. 12 seq.).
The priests have fallen into contempt (ii. 9) and have neglected
what is still one of their chief trusts, the oral law (ii. 6 seq.). The
priestly code of written law was not promulgated until 444 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
(Neh. viii.-x.); &ldquo;Malachi&rdquo; writes under the influence of the earlier
Code of Deuteronomy only,<a name="fa4i" id="fa4i" href="#ft4i"><span class="sp">4</span></a> and must therefore belong to a date
prior to 444. The independent character of the attack on
current abuses also suggests priority to the work of Ezra in
458. The prophecy affords an interesting and valuable glimpse
of the post-exilic community, with its various currents of thought
and life. The completion of the second Temple (516 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) has
been followed by disillusionment as to the anticipated prosperity,
by indifference to worship, scepticism as to providence, and
moral laxity.<a name="fa5i" id="fa5i" href="#ft5i"><span class="sp">5</span></a> In view of these conditions, the prophet&rsquo;s message
is to reassert the true relation of Israel to Yahweh, and to call
for a corresponding holiness, especially in regard to questions
of ritual and of marriage. He saw that &ldquo;the disobedience of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page455" id="page455"></a>455</span>
his time was the outcome of a lowered morality, not of a clearer
spiritual vision.&rdquo;<a name="fa6i" id="fa6i" href="#ft6i"><span class="sp">6</span></a> A strong sense of the unique privileges
of the children of Jacob, the objects of electing love (i. 2), the
children of the Divine Father (ii. 10), is combined with an equally
strong assurance of Yahweh&rsquo;s righteousness notwithstanding
the many miseries that pressed on the unhappy inhabitants of
Judaea. At an earlier date the prophet Haggai had taught
that the people could not expect Yahweh&rsquo;s blessing while the
Temple lay in ruins. In Malachi&rsquo;s time the Temple was built
(i. 10) and the priests waited in their office, but still a curse
seemed to rest on the nation&rsquo;s labours (iii. 9). To Malachi the
reason of this is plain. The &ldquo;law of Moses&rdquo; was forgotten
(iv. 4 [iii. 22]); let the people return to Yahweh, and He will
return to them. It was in vain to complain, saying, &ldquo;Every
one that doeth evil is good in the eyes of Yahweh,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Where
is the God of judgment?&rdquo;&mdash;vain to ask &ldquo;Wherein shall we
return?&rdquo; Obedience to the law is the sure path to blessing
(ii. 17-iii. 12).</p>

<p>He calls the people to repentance, and he enforces the call
by proclaiming the approach of Yahweh in judgment against
the sorcerers, the adulterers, the false swearers, the oppressors
of the poor, the orphan and the stranger. Then it shall be seen
that He is indeed a God of righteous judgment, distinguishing
between those that serve Him and those that serve Him not.
The Sun of Righteousness shall shine forth on those that fear
Yahweh&rsquo;s name; they shall go forth with joy, and tread the
wicked under foot. The conception of the day of final decision,
when Yahweh shall come suddenly to His temple (iii. 1) and
confound those who think the presumptuous godless happy
(iii. 15), is taken from earlier prophets, but is applied wholly
within the Jewish nation. The day of Yahweh would be a
curse, not a blessing, if it found the nation in its present state:
the priests listlessly performing a fraudulent service (i. 7-ii. 9),
the people bound by marriage to heathen women, while the
tears of the daughters of Israel, thrust aside to make way for
strangers, cover the altar (ii. 11-16), all faith in divine justice
gone (ii. 17; iii. 14 seq.), sorcery, uncleanness, falsehood and
oppression rampant (iii. 5), the house of God deprived of its
dues (iii. 8), and the true fearers of God a little flock gathered
together in private exercises of religion (perhaps the germ of
the later synagogue) in the midst of a godless nation (iii. 16).
That the day of Yahweh is delayed in such a state of things is
but a new proof of His unchanging love (iii. 6), which refuses
to consume the sons of Jacob. Meantime He is about to send
His messenger to prepare His way before Him. The prophet
Elijah must reappear to bring back the hearts of fathers and
children before the great and terrible day of Yahweh come.
Elijah was the advocate of national decision in the great concerns
of Israel&rsquo;s religion; and it is such decision, a clear recognition
of what the service of Yahweh means, a purging of His professed
worshippers from hypocritical and half-hearted service (iii. 3)
that Malachi with his intense religious earnestness sees to be
the only salvation of the nation. In thus looking to the return
of the ancient prophet to do the work for which later prophecy
is too weak, Malachi unconsciously signalizes the decay of the
order of which he was one of the last representatives; and the
somewhat mechanical measure which he applies to the people&rsquo;s
sins, as for example when he teaches that if the sacred dues were
rightly paid prosperous seasons would at once return (iii. 10),
heralds the advent of that system of formal legalism which
thought that all religious duty could be reduced to a system of
set rules. Yet Malachi himself is no mere formalist. To him,
as to the Deuteronomic legislation, the forms of legal observance
are of value only as the fitting expression of Israel&rsquo;s peculiar
sonship and service, and he shows himself a true prophet when
he contrasts the worthless ministry of unwilling priests with the
pure offering of prayer and praise that rises from the implicit
monotheism of even Gentile worship<a name="fa7i" id="fa7i" href="#ft7i"><span class="sp">7</span></a> (i. 11), or when he asserts
the brotherhood of all Israelites under their one Father (ii. 10),
not merely as a ground of separation from the heathen, but as
inconsistent with the selfish and cruel freedom of divorce current
in his time.<a name="fa8i" id="fa8i" href="#ft8i"><span class="sp">8</span></a> The book is a significant landmark in the religious
history of Israel. Its emphasis on the observance of ritual
finds fullest development in the Priestly Code, subsequently
promulgated; its protest against foreign marriages is made
effective through the reforms of Ezra and Nehemiah;<a name="fa9i" id="fa9i" href="#ft9i"><span class="sp">9</span></a> the
influence of its closing words on later expectation is familiar
to every reader of the new Testament.<a name="fa10i" id="fa10i" href="#ft10i"><span class="sp">10</span></a></p>

<p>The style of Malachi, like his argument, corresponds in its
generally prosaic character to that transformation or decay of
prophecy which began with Ezekiel; and Ewald rightly called
attention to the fact that the conduct of the argument already
shows traces of the dialectic manner of the schools. Yet there
is a simple dignity in the manner not unworthy of a prophet,
and rising from time to time to poetical rhythm.</p>

<p><a name="ft1i" id="ft1i" href="#fa1i"><span class="fn">1</span></a> A Hebrew tradition given in the Targum of Jonathan, and
approved by Jerome, identifies Malachi with Ezra the priest and
scribe.</p>

<p><a name="ft2i" id="ft2i" href="#fa2i"><span class="fn">2</span></a> Torrey (<i>Ency. Bib.</i> c. 2908) holds that the reference here is purely
figurative; &ldquo;Judah has dealt falsely with the wife of his youth,
the covenant religion, and is wedding a strange cult.&rdquo; But he
assigns the book to the 4th century.</p>

<p><a name="ft3i" id="ft3i" href="#fa3i"><span class="fn">3</span></a> This closing prophecy may possibly be a later addition (so Marti)
rounding off the prophetic canon by reference to the two great names
of Moses and Elijah, and their characteristic activities. In this case,
&ldquo;Elijah&rdquo; will represent an early interpretation (cf. Ecclus. xlviii.
10) of the &ldquo;messenger,&rdquo; originally conceived as a purely ideal figure.
The only other passage in the book whose originality is not generally
accepted is that referring to mixed marriages (ii. 11, 12).</p>

<p><a name="ft4i" id="ft4i" href="#fa4i"><span class="fn">4</span></a> It is the Deuteronomic law that is most familiar to him, as
appears from his use of the name Horeb for the mountain of the law,
and the Deuteronomic phrase &ldquo;statutes and judgments&rdquo; (iv. 4),
from his language as to tithes and offerings (iii. 8, 10; cf. Deut.
xii. 11; xxvi. 12), and especially from his conception of the priesthood
as resting on a covenant with Levi (ii. 4 seq.). Malachi indeed
assumes that the &ldquo;whole tithe&rdquo;&mdash;the Deuteronomic phrase for the
tithe in which the Levites shared&mdash;is not stored in each township,
but brought into the treasury at the Temple. But this was a modification
of the Deuteronomic law naturally called for under the circumstances
of the return from Babylon, and Neh. x. and xiii. produce
the impression that it was not introduced for the first time by Ezra
and Nehemiah, though the collection of the tithe was enforced by
them. See further, W.R.S. in <i>O.T.J.C.</i> ii. 425-427.</p>

<p><a name="ft7i" id="ft7i" href="#fa7i"><span class="fn">7</span></a> This remarkable utterance is sometimes (as by W.R.S.) interpreted
of the worship of Jews scattered in the Dispersion: reasons

<p><a name="ft8i" id="ft8i" href="#fa8i"><span class="fn">8</span></a> In ii. 16 the Targum renders &ldquo;If thou hatest her put her away.&rdquo;

put away his wife at will.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALACHITE,<a name="ar106" id="ar106"></a></span> a copper-ore of fine green colour, sometimes
polished as an ornamental stone. The name is derived from
Gr. <span class="grk" title="maláchê">&#956;&#945;&#955;&#940;&#967;&#951;</span>, the mallow, in allusion to the colour of the
mineral being rather like that of the mallow-leaf. Malachite
was perhaps one of the green minerals described by Theophrastus
under the general name of <span class="grk" title="smaragdos">&#963;&#956;&#940;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#948;&#959;&#962;</span>; and according to the
late Rev. C. W. King it was probably the <i>smaragdus medicus</i>
of Pliny, whilst his <i>molochites</i> seems to have been a different
stone from our malachite and may have been a green jasper.
It is suggested by J. L. Myres (<i>Ency. Bib.</i>) that malachite may
have been the Heb. <i>soham</i>, of the high priest&rsquo;s breastplate.</p>

<p>Malachite is a basic cupric carbonate, represented by the
formula CuCO<span class="su">3</span>Cu(HO)<span class="su">2</span>, and has usually been formed by the
action of meteoric agencies on other copper-minerals; hence
it is found in the upper part of ore-deposits, often as an incrustation,
and occasionally as a pseudomorph after cuprite, chalcocite,
&amp;c. When formed, as commonly happens, by the alteration
of copper-pyrites the iron of this mineral usually takes the form
of limonite, which may remain associated with the malachite.
Occasionally, though but rarely, malachite occurs in small dark-green
prismatic crystals of the monoclinic system. Its usual
mode of occurrence is in nodular or stalagmitic forms, with
a mammillated, reniform or botryoidal surface, whilst in other
cases it forms fibrous, compact or even earthy masses. The
nodules, though commonly dull on the outside, may display on
fracture a beautiful zonary structure, the successive layers often
succeeding each other as curved deposits of light and dark tints.
The colours include various shades of apple-green, grass-green,
emerald-green and verdigris-green. Certain varieties exhibit a
finely fibrous structure, producing on the fractured surface a
soft silky sheen.</p>

<p>Whilst malachite is found in greater or less quantity in most
copper-mines, the finer varieties useful for ornamental purposes
are of very limited occurrence, and the lapidary has generally
drawn his supply from Russia and Australia. The principal
source in recent years has been the Medno-Rudiansk mine near
Nizhne Tagilsk, on the Siberian side of the Urals, but it was
formerly obtained from mines near Bogoslovsk to the north
and Gumishev to the south of this locality. A mass from
Gumishev, preserved in the museum of the Mining Institute
of St Petersburg weighs 3240&#8468; and still larger masses have
been found near Nizhne Tagilsk. The mineral is prized in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page456" id="page456"></a>456</span>
Russia for use in mosaic-work, and for the manufacture of vases,
snuff-boxes and various ornamental objects. Even folding
doors, mantelpieces, table-tops and other articles of furniture
have been executed in malachite, the objects being veneered
with thin slabs cleverly fitted together so as to preserve the
pattern, and having the interspaces filled up with fragments
and powder of malachite applied with a cement. The malachite
is sawn into slabs, ground with emery and polished with tripoli.
Its hardness is less than 4, but it takes a good polish like marble:
it is rather denser than marble, having a specific gravity of
3.7 to 4, but it is more difficult to work, in consequence of a
tendency to break along the curved planes of deposition.
Exceptionally fine examples of the application of malachite
are seen in some of the columns of St Isaac&rsquo;s Cathedral in
St Petersburg, which are hollow iron columns encrusted with
malachite. Large masses of ornamental malachite have been
found in Australia, especially at the old Burra Burra copper-mine
in South Australia. The Copper Queen and other mines
in Arizona have yielded fine specimens of malachite associated
with azurite, and polished slabs of the mixed minerals sometimes
show the vivid green and the deep blue carbonate in
very striking contrast. This natural association, cut as an
ornamental stone, has been named, by Dr G. F. Kunz, azurmalachite.
Malachite is occasionally used for cameo-work,
and some fine antique examples are known. It was formerly
worn as an amulet to preserve the wearer from lightning,
contagion and witchcraft.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The mineral, when ground, has been used as a pigment under the
name of &ldquo;mountain green.&rdquo; The coarser masses are extensively
used, with other minerals, as ores of copper, malachite containing
about 57% of metal. &ldquo;Blue malachite&rdquo; is a name sometimes given
to azurite (<i>q.v.</i>), whilst &ldquo;siliceous malachite&rdquo; is a term inappropriately
applied to chrysocolla (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALACHOWSKI, STANISLAW<a name="ar107" id="ar107"></a></span> (1736-1809), Polish statesman,
the younger son of Stanislaw Malachowski, palatine of
Posen, the companion in arms of Sobieski. From his youth
Malachowski laboured zealously for the good of his country, and
as president of the royal court of justice won the honourable
title of the &ldquo;Polish Aristides.&rdquo; He was first elected a deputy
to the Coronation Diet of 1764, and the great Four Years&rsquo; Diet
unanimously elected him its speaker at the beginning of its
session in 1788. Accurately gauging the situation, Malachowski
speedily gathered round him all those who were striving to
uphold the falling republic and warmly supported every promising
project of reform. He was one of the framers of the constitution
of the 3rd of May 1791, exceeding in liberality all his
colleagues and advocating the extension of the franchise to
the towns and the emancipation of the serfs. He was the first
to enter his name as a citizen of Warsaw in the civic register and
to open negotiations with his own peasantry for their complete
liberation. Disappointed in his hopes by the overthrow of
the constitution, he resigned office and left the country in 1792,
going first to Italy and subsequently to his estates in Galicia,
where he was imprisoned for a time on a false suspicion of conspiracy.
In 1807 Malachowski was placed at the head of the
executive committee appointed at Warsaw after its evacuation
by the Prussians, and when the grand duchy of Warsaw was
created Malachowski became president of the senate under
King Frederick Augustus of Saxony. In the negotiations with
the Austrian government concerning the Galician salt-mines
Malachowski came to the assistance of the depleted treasury
by hypothecating all his estates as an additional guarantee.
In 1809 he died at Warsaw. His death was regarded as a
public calamity, and multitudes followed his remains to their
last resting-place in the Church of the Holy Cross. In all the
other towns of the grand duchy funeral services were held
simultaneously as a tribute of the respect and gratitude of the
Polish nation.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALACHY, ST<a name="ar108" id="ar108"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1094-1148), otherwise known as Maol-Maodhog
(or Maelmaedhog) Ua Morgair, archbishop of Armagh
and papal legate in Ireland, was born at Armagh. His father,
an Irish clergyman, the <i>Fearleighlinn</i>, or <i>lector</i>, at the university,
was said to have been of noble family. Having been ordained
to the priesthood, he for some time acted as vicar of Archbishop
Celsus or Ceallach of Armagh, and carried out many reforms
tending to increase conformity with the usage of the Church of
Rome. In order to improve his knowledge of the Roman
ritual he spent four years with Malchus, bishop of Lismore (in
Munster), a strong advocate of Romanism. Here he became
acquainted with Cormac MacCarthy, king of Desmond, who had
sought refuge with Malchus, and, when he subsequently regained
his kingdom, rendered great services to Malachy. On his
return from Lismore, Malachy undertook the government of
the decayed monastery of Bangor (in Co. Down), but very
soon afterwards he was elected bishop of Connor (now a small
village near Ballymena). After the sack of that place by the
king of Ulster he withdrew into Munster; here he was kindly
received by Cormac MacCarthy, with whose assistance he built
the monastery of Ibrach (in Kerry). Meanwhile he had been
designated by Celsus (in whose family the see of Armagh had
been hereditary for many years) to succeed him in the archbishopric;
in the interests of reform he reluctantly accepted the
dignity, and thus became involved for some years in a struggle
with the so-called heirs. Having finally settled the diocese, he
was permitted, as had been previously stipulated by himself, to
return to his former diocese, or rather to the smaller and poorer
portion of it, the bishopric of Down. Although the Roman
party had by this time obtained a firm hold in the north of Ireland,
the organization of the Church had not yet received the
sanction of the pope. Accordingly, in 1139, Malachy set out from
Ireland with the purpose of soliciting from the pope the pallium
(the token of archiepiscopal subjection to Rome) for the archbishop
of Armagh. On his way to Rome he visited Clairvaux,
and thus began a lifelong friendship with St Bernard. Malachy
was received by Innocent II. with great honour, and made papal
legate in Ireland, though the pope refused to grant the pallium
until it had been unanimously applied for &ldquo;by a general council
of the bishops, clergy and nobles.&rdquo; On his way home Malachy
revisited Clairvaux, and took with him from there four members
of the Cistercian order, by whom the abbey of Mellifont (in the
county of Louth) was afterwards founded in 1141. For the next
eight years after his return from Rome Malachy was active in
the discharge of his legatine duties, and in 1148, at a synod of
bishops and clergy held at Inis-Patrick (St Patrick&rsquo;s Island, near
Skerries, Co. Dublin), he was commissioned to return to Rome
and make fresh application for the pallium; he did not, however,
get beyond Clairvaux, where he died in the arms of St Bernard
on the 2nd of November 1148. The object of his life was realized
four years afterwards, in 1152, during the legateship of his successor.
Malachy was canonized by Clement III. in 1190.</p>

<p>The influence of Malachy in Irish ecclesiastical affairs has been
compared with that of Boniface in Germany. He reformed and
reorganized the Irish Church and brought it into subjection to
Rome; like Boniface, he was a zealous reformer and a promoter
of monasticism. But perhaps his chief claim to distinction is
that of having opened the first Cistercian monastery in Ireland,
five more being soon afterwards established. Several works
are attributed to him, but are all probably spurious. The most
curious of these is a <i>Prophecy concerning the Future Roman
Pontiffs</i>, which has produced an extensive literature. It is now
generally attributed to the year 1590, and is supposed to have
been forged to support the election of Cardinal Simoncelli to the
papal chair.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALACOSTRACA.<a name="ar109" id="ar109"></a></span> Under this zoological title are included
several groups of Crustacea (<i>q.v.</i>), united by characters which
attest their common origin, though some, and probably all of
them, were already separated in distant geological ages, and
some have now attained a peculiar isolation. Throughout the
whole, the researches made since 1860 have not only added a
great throng of new species, genera and families, but have thrown
a flood of light upon questions of their phylogeny, systematic
arrangement, horizontal and bathymetric distribution, organization,
habits of life and economic importance. There are at
least seven orders: the stalk-eyed Brachyura, Macrura, Schizopoda,
Stomatopoda, and the sessile-eyed Sympoda, Isopoda,
Amphipoda. An ocular segment claimed by the former division
is not present or in no case demonstrable in the latter. In
neither does the terminal segment or telson, whether large or
obsolescent, whether articulated or coalescent, carry appendages,
unless occasionally in fusion with itself. Between the eyes and
the tail-piece in all the orders nineteen segments are counted,
the proof of a segment&rsquo;s existence depending on its separateness,
complete or partial, or on a sutural indication, or else on the pair
of appendages known to belong to it. All these marks may fail,
and then the species must be proved to be Malacostracan by
other evidence than the number of its segments; but if some
exceptions exhibit fewer, none of the Malacostraca exhibits more
than 19 (+1 or + 2) segments, unless the Nebaliidae be included.
Of the corresponding pairs of appendages thirteen belong to the
head and trunk, two pairs of antennae, one pair of mandibles,
two pairs of maxillae, followed by three which may be all
maxillipeds or may help to swell the number of trunk-legs to
which the next five pairs belong. The abdomen or pleon carries
the remaining six pairs, of which from three to five are called
pleopods and the remainder uropods. Underlying the diversity
of names and functions and countless varieties of shape, there is a
common standard to which the appendages in general can be
referred. In the maxillipeds and the trunk-legs it is common
to find or otherwise easy to trace a seven-jointed stem, the endopod,
from which may spring two branches, the epipod from the
first joint, the exopod from the second.<a name="fa1j" id="fa1j" href="#ft1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The first antennae are
exceptional in branching, if at all, at the third joint. In the
mandibles and maxillae some of the terminal joints of the stem
are invariably wanting. In the rest of the appendages they may
either be wanting or indistinguishable. The latter obscurity
results either from coalescence, to which all joints and segments
are liable, or from subdivision, which occasionally affects joints
even in the trunk-legs. The carapace, formerly referred only
to the antennar-mandibular segments, may perhaps in fact
contain elements from any number of other segments of head
and trunk, Huxley, Alcock, Bouvier giving support to this
opinion by the sutural or other divisional lines in <i>Potamobius</i>,
<i>Nephrops</i>, <i>Thalassina</i>, and various fossil genera. Not all questions
of classification internal to this division are yet finally
settled. Between the Brachyura and Macrura some authors
uphold an order Anomura, though in a much restricted sense,
the labours of Huxley, Boas, Alcock and conjointly Alphonse
Milne-Edwards and Bouvier, having resulted in restoring the
Dromiidea and Raninidae to the Brachyura, among which
de Haan long ago placed them. The French authors argue that
from the macruran lobsters (<i>Nephropsidae</i>) anciently diverged
two lines: one leading through the Dromiidea to the genuine
Brachyura; or crabs, the other independently to the Anomura
proper, which may conveniently be named and classed as
<i>Macrura anomala</i>. Spence Bate maintained that the Schizopoda
ought not to form a separate order, but to be ranged as a macruran
tribe, &ldquo;more nearly allied to the degraded forms of the
Penaeidea than to those of any other group&rdquo; (<i>&rdquo;Challenger&rdquo;
Reports</i>, &ldquo;Macrura,&rdquo; p. 472, 1888). According to Sars, the
Sympoda (or Cumaceans), in spite of their sessile eyes, have
closer affinities with the stalk-eyed orders. H. J. Hansen and
others form a distinct order Tanaidea for the decidedly anomalous
group called by Sars <i>Isopoda chelifera</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>1. <span class="sc">Brachyura.</span>&mdash;For the present, as of old, the true Brachyura
are divided into four tribes: <i>Cyclometopa</i>, with arched front as
in the common eatable crab; <i>Catometopa</i>, with front bent down as in
the land-crabs and the little oyster-crab; <i>Oxyrhyncha</i>, with sharpened
beak-like front as in the various spider-crabs; <i>Oxystomata</i>,
including the Raninidae, and named not from the character of the
front but from that of the buccal frame which is usually narrowed
forwards. In these tribes the bold and active habits, the striking
colours, or the fantastic diversities of structure, have so long attracted
remark that recent investigations, while adding a multitude of new
species and supplying the specialist with an infinity of new details,
have not materially altered the scientific standpoint. New light,
however, has been thrown upon the &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; capacity of
Crustacea by the proof that the spider-crabs deliberately use changes
of raiment to harmonize with their surroundings, donning and doffing
various natural objects as we do our manufactured clothes. Others
have the power of producing sounds, one use to which they put this
faculty being apparently to signal from their burrow in the sand
that they are &ldquo;not at home&rdquo; to an inopportune visitor. Deep-sea
exploration has shown that some species have an immensely extended
range, and still more, that species of the same genus, and genera
of the same family, though separated by great intervals of space,
may be closely allied in character. A curious effect of parasitism,
well illustrated in crabs, though not confined to them, has been
expounded by Professor Giard, namely, that it tends to obliterate
the secondary sexual characters. Modern research has discovered
no crab to surpass <i>Macrocheira kämpferi</i>, De Haan, that can span
between three and four yards with the tips of its toes, but at the
other end of the scale it has yielded <i>Collodes malabaricus</i>, Alcock,
&ldquo;of which the carapace, in an adult and egg-laden female, is less
than one-sixth of an inch in its greatest diameter.&rdquo; The most
abyssal of all crabs yet known is <i>Ethusina abyssicola</i>, Smith, or
what is perhaps only a variety of it, <i>E. challengeri</i>, Miers. Of
the latter the &ldquo;Albatross&rdquo; obtained a specimen from a depth of
2232 fathoms (Faxon, 1895), of the former from 2221 fathoms,
and of this S. I. Smith remarks that it has &ldquo;distinctly faceted black
eyes,&rdquo; although in them &ldquo;there are only a very few visual elements
at the tips of the immobile eye-stalks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>Brachyura anomala</i>, or Dromiidea, &ldquo;have preserved the external
characters and probably also the organization of the Brachyura
of the Secondary epoch&rdquo; (Milne-Edwards and Bouvier, 1901).
They agree with the true crabs in not having appendages (uropods)
to the sixth segment of the pleon, the atrophy being complete in the
Homolidae and Homolodromiidae, whereas in the Dromiidae and
Dynomenidae a pair of small plates appear to be vestiges of these
organs. In the family Homolidae stands the strange genus <i>Latreillia</i>,
Roux, with long slender limbs and triangular carapace after the
fashion of oxyrhynch spider-crabs. In <i>Homola</i> the carapace is
quadrilateral. Between these two a very interesting link was
discovered by the &ldquo;Challenger&rdquo; in the species <i>Latreillopsis bispinosa</i>.
Henderson. Bouvier (1896) has shown that <i>Palaeinachus longipes</i>,
Woodward, from the Forest Marble of Wiltshire, is in close relationship,
not to the oxyrhynch Inachidae, but to the genera <i>Homolodromia</i>
and <i>Dicranodromia</i> of the Homolodromiidae, and that the
Jurassic crabs in general, of the family Prosoponidae (Meyer),
are Dromiidea.</p>

<p>2. <span class="sc">Macrura.</span>&mdash;The <i>Macrura anomala</i>, or Anomura in restricted
sense, are popularly known through the hermit-crabs alone. These
only partially represent one of the three main divisions, Paguridea,
Galatheidea, Hippidea. The first of these is subdivided into <i>Pagurinea</i>,
<i>Lithodinea</i>, <i>Lomisinea</i>, each with a literature of its own. Among
the Pagurinea is the <i>Birgus latro</i>, or robber-crab, whose expertness in
climbing the coco-nut palm need no longer be doubted, since in
recent years it has been noted and photographed by trustworthy
naturalists in the very act. Alcock &ldquo;observed one of these crabs
drinking from a runnel of rain-water, by dipping the fingers of one
of its chelipeds into the water and then carrying the wet fingers to
its mouth.&rdquo; Hermits of the genus <i>Coenobita</i> he found feeding
voraciously on nestling sea-terns. That pagurids must have the
usually soft pleon or abdomen protected by the shell of a mollusc
is now known to be subject to a multitude of exceptions. <i>Birgus</i>
dispenses with a covering; <i>Coenobita</i> can make shift with half the
shell of a coco-nut; <i>Chlaenopagurus</i> wraps itself up in a blanket
of colonial polyps; <i>Cancellus tanneri</i>, Faxon, was found in a piece
of dead coral rock; <i>Xylopagurus rectus</i>, A. Milne-Edwards, lodges
in tubes of timber or bits of hollow reed. The last-named species
has a straight symmetrical abdomen, with the penultimate segment
expanded and strongly calcified to form a back-door to the very
unconventional habitation. This it enters head-foremost from
the rear, while &ldquo;hermits&rdquo; in general are forced to go backwards
into their spiral or tapering shelters by the front. Some of the
species can live in the ocean at a depth of two or three miles. Some
can range inland up to a considerable height on mountains. The
advantage that this group has derived from the adoption of mollusc
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page458" id="page458"></a>458</span>
shells as houses or fortresses, ready built and light enough for easy
transport, is obviously discounted by a twofold inconvenience.
There is nothing to ensure that the supply will be equal to the demand,
and Nature has not arranged that the borrowed tenement shall
continue to grow with the growth of its new tenant. To meet these
defects it is found that numerous species encourage or demand the
companionship of various zoophytes, simple or colonial. These
sometimes completely absorb the shell on which they are settled,
but then act as a substitute for it, and in any case by their outgrowth
they extend the limits of the dwelling, so that the inmate
can grow in comfort without having to hunt or fight for a larger
abode. Among the <i>Lithodinea</i>, or stone crabs, besides important
readjustments of classification (Bouvier, 1895, 1896), should be
noticed the evidence of their cosmopolitan range, and the species
<i>Neolithodes agassizii</i> (Smith) and <i>N. grimaldii</i>, Milne-Edwards and
Bouvier, which carry to an extreme the spinosity characteristic of
the group (fig. 1). S. I. Smith&rsquo;s investigations on the early stages
of <i>Hippa talpoida</i>, Say, were published in 1877.</p>

<p>With regard to the accessions to knowledge in the enormous
group of the genuine Macrura, reference need only be made to the
extensive reports in which Spence Bate, S. I. Smith, Faxon, Wood-Mason,
Alcock, and others have made known the results of celebrated
explorations. Various larval stages have been successfully investigated
by Sars. Alcock (1901) describes from his own observation
the newly hatched <i>Phyllosoma</i> larva of <i>Thenus orientalis</i>, Fabricius.
An admirable discrimination of the larval and adult characters of
the genus <i>Sergestes</i> has been given by H. J. Hansen (<i>Proc. Zool. Soc.</i>,
London, 1896). Singularity excites our wonder in <i>Thaumastocheles
zaleucus</i>, v. Willemoes Suhm, which makes up for its vanished eyes
by its extraordinarily elongate and dentated claws; in <i>Psalidopus
huxleyi</i>, Wood-Mason and Alcock (1892), bristling with spikes from
head to tail; in the Nematocarcinidae, with their long thread-like
limbs and longer antennae; in species of <i>Aristaeopsis</i> reported by Chun
from deep water off the east coast of Africa, bright red prawns nearly
a foot long, with antennae about five times the length of the body.
That certain species, particularly many from deep water, have
disproportionately large eggs, is explained by the supposition that
the young derive the advantage of being hatched in an advanced
stage of development.</p>

<p>3. <span class="sc">Schizopoda.</span>&mdash;This order of animals for the most part
delicately beautiful, has for the moment five families&mdash;Lophogastridae,
Eucopiidae, Euphausiidae,
Mysidae and Anaspididae. In the
Euphausiidae the digitiform-arborescent
branchiae, as if conscious of
their own extreme elegance, remain
wholly uncovered. In the two preceding
families they are partially
covered. In the Mysidae the branchiae
are wanting, and some would form
this family into a separate order,
Mysidacea. In <i>Anaspides</i>, a peculiar
fresh-water genus discovered in
1892 by G. M. Thomson on Mount
Wellington, in Tasmania, the gills
are not arborescent, and there are
seven segments of the trunk free of
the carapace (fig. 2). A membranaceous
carapace separates the Eucopiidae
from the more solidly invested Lophogastridae. Among many
papers that the student will find it necessary to consult may be
mentioned the &ldquo;<i>Challenger</i>&rdquo; <i>Report</i> on Schizopoda, by Sars, 1885,
dealing with the order at large; &ldquo;British Schizopoda,&rdquo; by Norman
<i>Ann. Nat. Hist.</i> (1892); &ldquo;Decapoden und Schizopoden,&rdquo; <i>Plankton-Expedition</i>
(Ortmann, 1893); &ldquo;Euphausiidae,&rdquo; by Stebbing, <i>Proc.
Zool. Soc.</i> (London, 1900); <i>Mysidae of the Russian Empire</i>, by
Czerniavski (1882-1883); and <i>Mysidae of the Caspian</i>, by Sars
(1893-1895-1897).</p>

<p>4. <span class="sc">Stomatopoda</span>.&mdash;This order, at one time a medley of heterogeneous
forms, is now confined to the singularly compact group of
the Squillidae. Here the articulation of the ocular segment is unusually
distinct, and here two characters quite foreign to all the
preceding groups come into view. The second maxillipeds are
developed into powerful prehensile organs, and the branchiae, instead
of being connected with the appendages of head and trunk, are
developed on the pleopods, appendages of the abdomen. At least
three segments of the trunk are left uncovered by the carapace.
The developing eggs are not carried about by the mother, but
deposited in her subaqueous burrow, &ldquo;where they are aerated by the
currents of water produced by the abdominal feet of the parent.&rdquo;
An excellent synopsis of the genera and species is provided by
R. P. Bigelow (<i>Proc. U.S. Mus.</i> vol. xvii., 1894). For the habits and
peculiarities of these and many other Crustaceans, A. E. Verrill
and S. I. Smith on the <i>Invertebrates of Vineyard Sound</i> should be consulted
(1874). The general subject has been illuminated by the
labours of Claus, Miers, Brooks (<i>&rdquo;Challenger&rdquo; Report</i>, 1886), and the
latest word on the relationship between the various larvae and
their respective genera has been spoken by H. J. Hansen (<i>Plankton-Expedition
Report</i>, 1895). The striking forms of <i>Alima</i> and <i>Erichthus</i>,
at one time regarded as distinct genera, are now with more
or less certainty affiliated to their several squillid parents.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig</span>. 3.&mdash;<i>Pseudocuma pectinatum</i>, Sowinsky.</td></tr></table>

<p>5. <span class="sc">Sympoda</span>.&mdash;This order of sessile-eyed decapods was absolutely
unknown to science till 1779. A species certainly belonging to it
was described by Lepekhin in 1780, but the obscure <i>Gammarus esca</i>,
&ldquo;food Gammarus&rdquo; beloved of herrings, described by J. C. Fabricius
in the preceding year, may also be one of its members. Nutritious
possibilities are implied in <i>Diastylis rathkii</i>, Kröyer, one of the
largest forms, which, though slender and rarely an inch long, in its
favourite Arctic waters is found &ldquo;in incalculable masses, in thousands
of specimens&rdquo; (Stuxberg, 1880). Far on in the 19th century
eminent naturalists were still debating whether in this group there
were eyes or no eyes, whether the eyes were stalked or sessile, whether
the animals observed were larval or adult. The American T. Say in
1818 gave a good description of a new species and founded the premier
genus <i>Diastylis</i>, but other investigators derived little credit
from the subject till more than sixty years after its introduction by
the Russian Lepekhin. Then Goodsir, Kröyer, Lilljeborg, Spence
Bate and one or two others made considerable advances, and in
1865 a memorable paper by G. O. Sars led the way to the great
series of researches which he has continued to the present day.
The name <i>Cumacea</i>, however, which he uses cannot be retained,
being founded on the preoccupied name <i>Cuma</i> (Milne-Edwards,
1828). The more recent name <i>Sympoda</i> (see Willey, <i>Results</i>, pt. v.
p. 609, 1900) alludes to the huddling together of the legs, which is conspicuous
in most of the species. Ten families are now distinguished&mdash;Diastylidae,
Lampropidae, Platyaspidae, Pseudocumidae, all with
an articulated telson; without one, the Bodotriidae (formerly called
<i>Cumidae</i>), Vaunthompsoniidae, Leuconidae, Nannastacidae, Campylaspidae,
Procampylaspidae. All the Leuconidae and Procampylaspidae
are blind, and some species in most of the other families.
Usually the sides of the carapace are strangely produced into a mock
rostrum in front of the ocular lobe, be it oculiferous or not. The
last four or five segments of the trunk are free from the carapace.
The slender pleon has always six distinct segments, the sixth carrying
two-branched uropods, the preceding five armed with no pleopods
in the female, whereas in the male the number of pairs varies from
five to none. The resemblance of these creatures to miniature
Macrura is alluded to in the generic name <i>Nannastacus</i>, meaning
dwarf-lobster. In this genus alone of the known Sympoda the eyes
sometimes form a pair, in accordance with the custom of all other
malacostracan orders except this and of this order itself in the
embryo (Sars, 1900). The most but not the only remarkable character
lies in the first maxillipeds. These, with the main stem more
or less pediform, have the epipod and exopod modified for respiratory
purposes. The backward-directed epipods usually carry branchial
vesicles. The forward-directed exopods either act as valves or
form a tube (rarely two tubes), protensile and retractile, for regulating
egress of water from the branchial regions. This mechanism
as a whole is unique, although, as Sars observes, the epipod of the
first maxillipeds has a respiratory function also in the Lophogastridae
and Mysidae and in the cheliferous isopods. As a rule armature of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page459" id="page459"></a>459</span>
the carapace is much more developed in the comparatively sedentary
female than in the usually more active male. Only in the male
do the second antennae attain considerable length, with strong
resemblance to what is found in some of the Amphipoda. About
150 species distributed among thirty-four genera are now known,
many from shallow water and from between tide-marks, some from
very great depths. H. J. Hansen concludes that &ldquo;they are all
typically ground animals, and as yet no species has been taken under
such conditions that it could be reckoned to the pelagic plankton.&rdquo;
As they have been found in all zones and chiefly by a very few
observers, it is probable that a great many more species remain to
be discovered. In recent years thirteen species, all belonging to
the same genus <i>Pseudocuma</i> (fig. 3), have been recorded by Sars from
the Caspian Sea. A bibliography of the order is given in that
author&rsquo;s <i>Crustacea of Norway</i>, vol. iii. (1899-1900).</p>

<p>6. <span class="sc">Isopoda</span>.&mdash;This vast and populous order can be traced far
back in geological time. It is now represented in all seas and
lands, in fresh-water lakes and streams, and even in warm springs.
It adapts itself to parasitic life not only in fishes, but in its own
class Crustacea, and that in species of every order, its own included.
In this process changes of structure are apt to occur, and sometimes
unimaginable sacrifices of the normal appearance. The order
has been divided into seven tribes, of which a fuller summary than
can here be given will be found in Stebbing, <i>History of Crustacea</i>
(1893). The first tribe, called Chelifera, from the usually chelate
or claw-bearing first limbs, may be regarded as <i>Isopoda anomala</i>,
of which some authors would form a separate order, Tanaidea.
Like the genuine isopods, they have seven pairs of trunk-legs, but
instead of having seven segments of the middle body (or peraeon)
normally free, they have the first one or two of its segments coalesced
with the head. Instead of the breathing organs being furnished by
the appendages of the pleon with the heart in their vicinity, the
respiration is controlled by the maxillipeds, with the heart in the
peraeon (see Delage, <i>Arch. Zool. expér. et gén.</i>, vol. ix., 1881). There
are two families, Tanaidae and Apseudidae. Occasionally the ocular
lobes are articulated.</p>

<p>The genuine Isopoda are divided among the <i>Flabellifera</i>, in which
the terminal segment and uropods form a flabellum or swimming
fan; the <i>Epicaridea</i>, parasitic on Crustaceans; the <i>Valvifera</i>, in which
the uropods fold valve-like over the branchial pleopods; the <i>Asellota</i>,
in which the first pair of pleopods of the female are usually transformed
into a single opercular plate; the <i>Phreatoicidea</i>, a fresh-water
tribe, known as yet only from subterranean waters in New Zealand
and an Australian swamp nearly 6000 ft. above sea-level; and lastly,
the <i>Oniscidea</i>, which are terrestrial. Only the last of these, under
the contemptuous designation of wood-lice, has established a feeble
claim to popular recognition. Few persons hear without surprise
that England itself possesses more than a score of species in this air-breathing
tribe. Those known from the world at large number
hundreds of species, distributed among dozens of genera in six
families. That a wood-louse and a land-crab are alike Malacostracans,
and that they have by different paths alike become adapted
to terrestrial life, are facts which even a philosopher might condescend
to notice. Of the other tribes which are aquatic there is
not space to give even the barest outline. Their swarming multitudes
are of enormous importance in the economy of the sea. If in
their relation to fish it must be admitted that many of them plague
the living and devour the dead, in return the fish feed rapaciously
upon them. Among the most curious of recent discoveries is that
relating to some of the parasitic <i>Cymothoidae</i>, as to which Bullar
has shown that the same individual can be developed first as a male
and then as a female. Of lately discovered species the most striking
is one of the deep-sea Cirolanidae, <i>Bathynomus giganteus</i>, A. M.
Edwards (1879), which is unique in having supplementary ramified
branchiae developed at the bases of the pleopods. Its eyes are
said to contain nearly 4000 facets. The animal attains what in
this order is the monstrous size of 9 in. by 4. A general uniformity
of the trunk-limbs in Isopoda justifies the ordinal name, but the
valviferous Astacillidae, and among the Asellota the Munnopsidae,
offer some remarkable exceptions to this characteristic. Among
many essential works on this group may be named the <i>Monogr.
Cymothoarum</i> of Schiödte and Meinert (1879-1883); &ldquo;<i>Challenger</i>&rdquo;
<i>Report</i>, Beddard (1884-1886); <i>Cirolanidae</i>, H. J. Hansen (1890);
<i>Isopoda Terrestria</i>, Budde-Lund (1885); <i>Bopyridae</i>, Bonnier (1900);
<i>Crustacea of Norway</i>, vol. ii. (Isopoda), Sars (1896-1899), while their
multitude precludes specification of important contributions by
Benedict, Bovallius, Chilton, Dohrn, Dollfus, Fraisse, Giard and
Bonnier, Harger, Haswell, Kossmann, Miers, M&rsquo;Murrich, Norman,
Harriet Richardson, Ohlin, Studer, G. M. Thomson, A. O. Walker,
Max Weber and many others.</p>

<p>7. <span class="sc">Amphipoda.</span>&mdash;As in the genuine Isopoda, the eyes of Amphipoda
are always sessile, and generally paired, and, in contrast to
crabs and lobsters, these two groups have only four pairs of mouth-organs
instead of six, but seven pairs of trunk-legs instead of five.
From the above-named isopods the present order is strongly differentiated
by having heart and breathing organs not in the pleon,
but in the peraeon, or middle body, the more or less simple branchial
vesicles being attached to some or all of the last six pairs of trunk-legs.
Normally the pleon carries six pairs of two-branched appendages,
of which the first three are much articulated flexible swimming
feet, the last three few-jointed comparatively indurated uropods.
There are three tribes, <i>Gammaridea</i>, <i>Caprellidea</i>, <i>Hyperiidea</i>. The
middle one contains but two families, the cylindrical and often
thread-like skeleton shrimps, Caprellidae, and their near cousins,
the broad, flattened, so-called whale-lice, Cyamidae. This tribe
has the pleon dwindled into insignificance, whereas in the other two
tribes it is powerfully developed. The Hyperiidea are distinguished
by having their maxillipeds never more than three-jointed. In the
companion tribes these appendages have normally seven joints, and
always more than three. The order thus sharply divided is united
by an intimate interlacing of characters, and forms a compact whole
at present defying intrusion from any other crustacean group.
Since 1775, when J. C. Fabricius instituted the genus <i>Gammarus</i>
for five species, of which only three were amphipods, while he left
five other amphipods in the genus <i>Oniscus</i>, from this total of eight
science has developed the order, at first very slowly, but of late by
great leaps and bounds, so that now the <i>Gammaridea</i> alone comprise
more than 1300 species, distributed among some 300 genera and 39
families. They burrow in the sands of every shore; they throng
the weeds between tide-marks; they ascend all streams; they are
found in deep wells, in caverns, in lakes; in Arctic waters they swarm
in numbers beyond computation; they find lodgings on crabs, on
turtles, on weed-grown buoys; they descend into depths of the ocean
down to hundreds or thousands of fathoms; they are found in mountain
streams as far above sea-level as some of their congeners live
below it. The Talitridae, better known as sandhoppers, can forgo
the briny shore and content themselves with the damp foliage of
inland forests or casual humidity in the crater of an extinct volcano.
Over the ocean surface, as well as at various depths, float and swim
innumerable <i>Hyperiidea</i>&mdash;the wonderful <i>Phronima</i>, glass-like in its
glassy barrel hollowed out of some Tunicate; the <i>Cystisoma</i>, 4 or 5 in.
long, with its eye-covered head; the <i>Rhabdosoma</i>, like a thin rod
of glass, with needle-like head and tail, large eyes, but limbs and
mouth-organs all in miniature, and the second antennae of the male
folding up like a carpenter&rsquo;s rule (fig. 4). On jelly-fishes are to be
found species of <i>Hyperia</i> and their kindred, so fat and wholesome
that they have been commended to shipwrecked men in open boats
as an easily procurable resource against starvation. Many of the
Amphipoda are extremely voracious. Some of them are even
cannibals. The Cyamidæ afflict the giant whale by nibbling away
its skin; the <i>Chelura terebrans</i> is destructive to submerged timber.
But, on the other hand, they largely help to clear the sea and other
waters of refuse and carrion, and for fishes, seals and whales they are
food desirable and often astoundingly copious. From the little
flea-like species, scarcely a tenth of an inch long, up to the great and
rare but cosmopolitan <i>Eurythenes gryllus</i>, Lichtenstein, and the
still larger <i>Alicella gigantea</i>, Chevreux, nearly half a foot long, captured
by the prince of Monaco from a depth of 2936 fathoms, not
one of these ubiquitous, uncountable hordes has ever been accused
of assailing man. For the naturalist they have the recommendation
that many are easy to obtain, that most, apart from the very minute,
are easy to handle, and that all, except as to the fleeting colours, are
easy to preserve.</p>

<p>A nearly complete bibliography of the order down to 1888 will be
found in the &ldquo;<i>Challenger</i>&rdquo; <i>Reports</i>, vol. xxviii., and supplementary
notices in Della Valle&rsquo;s <i>Monograph of the Gammarini</i> (1893), the scope
of his work, however, not covering the Hyperiidea and Oxycephalidae
of Bovallius (1889, 1890); but since these dates very numerous
additions to the literature have been made by Birula, Bonnier,
Norman, Walker and others, especially the <i>Crustacea of Norway</i>, vol. i.
(<i>Amphipoda</i>), Sars (1890-1895), demanding attention, and the quite
recent <i>Amphipoda of the Hirondelle</i>, Chevreux (1900), and <i>Hyperiidea
of the Plankton-Expedition</i>, Vosseler (1901).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALAGA,<a name="ar110" id="ar110"></a></span> a maritime province of southern Spain, one of
the eight modern subdivisions of Andalusia; bounded on the
W. by Cadiz, N. by Seville and Cordova, E. by Granada, and
S. by the Mediterranean Sea. Pop. (1900), 511,989; area, 2812
sq. m. The northern half of Malaga belongs to the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page460" id="page460"></a>460</span>
Andalusian plain watered by the Guadalquivir, the southern is
mountainous, and rises steeply from the coast. Of the numerous
sierras may be mentioned that of Alhama, separating the province
from Granada, and at one point rising above 7000 ft.; its westward
continuation in the Sierra de Abdalajis and the Axarquia
between Antequera and Malaga; and not far from the Cadiz
boundary the Sierras de Ronda, de Mijas, de Tolox and Bermeja,
converging and culminating in a summit of nearly 6500 ft.
The rivers which rise in the watershed formed by all these ranges
reach the sea after a short and precipitous descent, and in rainy
seasons are very liable to overflow their banks. In 1907 great
loss of life and destruction of property were caused in this manner.
The principal river is the Guadalhorce, which rises in the Sierra de
Alhama, and, after a westerly course past the vicinity of Antequera,
bends southward through the wild defile of Peñarrubia
and the beautiful <i>vega</i> or vale of Malaga, falling into the sea near
that city. The only other considerable stream is the Guadiaro,
which has the greater part of its course within the province
and flows past Ronda. There is an extensive salt lagoon near
the northern boundary. The mountains are rich in minerals,
lead, and (in the neighbourhood of Marbella) iron, being
obtained in large quantities. There are warm sulphurous springs
and baths at Carratraca. Though the methods of agriculture
are for the most part rude, the yield of wheat in good seasons is
considerably in excess of the local demand; and large quantities
of grapes and raisins, oranges and lemons, figs and almonds,
are annually exported. The oil and wines of Malaga are also
highly esteemed, and after 1870 the manufacture of beet and cane
sugar developed into an important industry. In 1905 there were
about 500 flour mills and 230 oil factories beside 95 stills and 100
wine-presses in the province. Malaga has suffered severely
from the agricultural depression prevalent throughout southern
Spain, but its manufacturing industries tend to expand. The
fisheries are important; a fleet of about 300 boats brings in
18,000,000 &#8468; annually, of which 25% is exported. The internal
communications are in many parts defective, owing to the
broken nature of the surface; but the province is traversed from
north to south by the Cordova-Malaga railway, which sends off
branches from Bobadilla to Granada and Algeciras. A branch
line along the coast from Malaga to Vélez Malaga was opened in
1908.</p>

<p>Malaga, the capital (pop. 130,109), Antequera (31,609), Vélez

are described in separate articles. Other towns with more than
7000 inhabitants are Marbella (9629), Estepona (9310), Archidona
(8880) and Nerja (7112). The population of the province tends
gradually to decrease, as many families emigrate to South America,
Algeria and Hawaii.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALAGA,<a name="ar111" id="ar111"></a></span> the capital of the province of Malaga, an episcopal
see, and, next to Barcelona, the most important seaport of Spain,
finely situated on the Mediterranean coast, at the southern base
of the Axarquia hills and at the eastern extremity of the fertile
vega (plain) of Malaga in 36° 43&prime; N. and 4° 25&prime; W. Pop. (1900),
130,109. From the clearness of its sky, and the beautiful
sweep of its bay, Malaga has sometimes been compared with
Naples. The climate is one of the mildest and most equable in
Europe, the mean annual temperature being 66.7° Fahr. The
principal railway inland gives access through Bobadilla to all
parts of Spain, and a branch line along the coast to Vélez-Malaga
was opened in 1908. Malaga lies principally on the left bank of a
mountain torrent, the Guadalmedina (&ldquo;river of the city&rdquo;); the
streets near the sea are spacious and comparatively modern,
but those in the older part of the town, where the buildings are
huddled around the ancient citadel, are narrow, winding and
often dilapidated. Well-built suburbs have also spread on all
sides into the rich and pleasant country which surrounds Malaga,
and several acres of land reclaimed from the sea have been converted
into a public park. There are various squares or plazas
and public promenades; of the former the most important are the
Plaza de Riego (containing the monument to General José Maria
Torrijos, who, with forty-eight others, was executed in Malaga
on the 11th of December 1831, for promoting an insurrection
in favour of the constitution) and the Plaza de la Constitucion;
adjoining the quays is the fine Paseo de la Alameda. The
city has no public buildings of commanding architectural or
historical importance. The cathedral, on the site of an ancient
mosque, was begun about 1528; after its construction had
been twice interrupted, it was completed to its present state
in the 18th century, and is in consequence an obtrusive record
of the degeneration of Spanish architecture. The woodwork of
the choir, however, is worthy of attention. The church of El
Cristo de la Victoria contains some relics of the siege of 1487.
There are an English church and an English cemetery, which
dates from 1830; up to that year all Protestants who died in
Malaga were buried on the foreshore, where their bodies were
frequently exposed by the action of wind and sea. Of the old
Moorish arsenal only a single horseshoe gateway remains, the
rest of the site being chiefly occupied by an iron structure used
as a market; the Alcazába, or citadel, has almost disappeared.
The castle of Gibralfaro, on a bold eminence to the north-east
dates from the 13th century, and is still in fairly good
preservation.</p>

<p>During the 19th century so much silt accumulated in the harbour
that vessels were obliged to lie in the roads outside, and
receive and discharge cargo by means of lighters; but new harbour
works were undertaken in 1880, and large ships can now again
load or discharge at the quays, which are connected with the main
railway system by a branch line. About 2150 ships of 1,750,000
tons enter at Malaga every year. Iron, lead, wine, olive oil,
almonds, fresh and dried fruit, palmetto hats and canary seed are
exported in large quantities, while the imports include grain,
codfish, fuel, chemicals, iron and steel, machinery, manures and
staves for casks. Although trade was impeded during the early
years of the 20th century by a succession of bad harvests and
by the disastrous floods of September 1907, the number of industries
carried on in and near Malaga tends steadily to increase.
There are large cotton mills, iron foundries, smelting works and
engineering works. Pottery, mosaic, artificial stone and tiles
are produced chiefly for the home market, though smaller
quantities are sent abroad. There is a chromo-lithographic
establishment, and the other industries include tanning, distilling
and the manufacture of sugar, chocolate, soap, candles, artificial
ice, chemical products, white lead and pianos. Foreign capital
has played a prominent part in the development of Malaga; a
French syndicate owns the gas-works, and the electric lighting
of the streets is controlled by British and German companies.</p>

<p>Malaga is the <span class="grk" title="Málaka">&#924;&#940;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#945;</span> of Strabo (iii. 156) and Ptolemy (ii. 4, 7)
and the <i>Malaca foederatorum</i> of Pliny (iii. 3). The place
seems to have been of some importance even during the Carthaginian
period; under the Romans it became a municipium, and
under the Visigoths an episcopal see. In 711 it passed into the
possession of the Moors, and soon came to be regarded as one
of the most important cities of Andalusia. It was attached to
the caliphate of Cordova, but on the fall of the Omayyad dynasty
it became for a short time the capital of an independent kingdom;
afterwards it was dependent on Granada. In 1487 it was taken
and treated with great harshness by Ferdinand and Isabella
after a protracted siege. In 1810 it was sacked by the French
under General Sebastiani. The citizens of Malaga are noted
for their opposition to the Madrid government; they took a
prominent part in the movements against Espartero (1843),
against Queen Isabella (1868) and in favour of a republic (1873).</p>

Province of India, connecting the British district of Peshawar
with the Swat Valley. It is now a military post and the headquarters
of a political agency. It came into prominence for the
first time in 1895 during the Chitral campaign, when 7000
Pathans held it against Sir Robert Low&rsquo;s advance, but were
easily routed. After the campaign was over a fortified camp was
formed on the Malakand to guard the road to Chitral. During
the frontier risings of 1897 the Swatis made a determined attack
on the Malakand, where 700 were killed, and on the adjacent
post of Chakdara, where 2000 were killed. This was the
origin of the Malakand Expedition of the same year. (See

Byzantine chronicler, was born at Antioch. He wrote a
<span class="grk" title="Chronographia">&#935;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#943;&#945;</span> in 18 books, the beginning and the end of which
are lost. In its present state it begins with the mythical history
of Egypt and ends with the expedition to Africa under Marcianus,
the nephew of Justinian. Except for the history of Justinian
and his immediate predecessors, it possesses little historical
value; it is written without any idea of proportion and contains
astonishing blunders. The writer is a supporter of Church and
State, an upholder of monarchical principles. The work is rather
a chronicle written round Antioch, which he regarded as the
centre of the world, and (in the later books) round Constantinople.
It is, however, important as the first specimen of a
chronicle written not for the learned but for the instruction of
the monks and the common people, in the language of the vulgar,
with an admixture of Latin and Oriental words. It obtained
great popularity, and was conscientiously exploited by various
writers until the 11th century, being translated even into the
Slavonic languages. It is preserved in an abridged form in a
single MS. now at Oxford.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALAN, SOLOMON CAESAR<a name="ar114" id="ar114"></a></span> (1812-1894), British divine
and orientalist, was by birth a Swiss descended from an exiled
French family, and was born at Geneva on the 22nd of April
1812, where his father, Dr Henry Abraham Caesar Malan
(1787-1864) enjoyed a great reputation as a Protestant divine.
From his earliest youth he manifested a remarkable faculty for
the study of languages, and when he came to Scotland as tutor
in the marquis of Tweeddale&rsquo;s family at the age of 18 he had
already made progress in Sanskrit, Arabic and Hebrew. In 1833
he matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford; and English being
almost an unknown tongue to him, he petitioned the examiners
to allow him to do his paper work of the examination in French,
German, Spanish, Italian, Latin or Greek, rather than in English.
But his request was not granted. After gaining the Boden and
the Pusey and Ellerton scholarships, he graduated 2nd class in
<i>Lit. hum.</i> in 1837. He then proceeded to India as classical
lecturer at Bishop&rsquo;s College, Calcutta, to which post he added
the duties of secretary to the Bengal branch of the Royal Asiatic
Society; and although compelled by illness to return in 1840,
laid the foundation of a knowledge of Tibetan and Chinese.
After serving various curacies, he was presented in 1845 to the
living of Broadwindsor, Dorset, which he held until 1886.
During this entire period he continued to augment his linguistic
knowledge, which he carried so far as to be able to preach in that
most difficult language, Georgian, on a visit which he paid to
Nineveh in 1872. His translations from the Armenian, Georgian
and Coptic were numerous. He applied his Chinese learning to
the determination of important points connected with Chinese
religion, and published a vast number of parallel passages illustrative
of the Book of Proverbs. In 1880 the university of
Edinburgh conferred upon him the honorary degree of D.D.
No modern scholar, perhaps, has so nearly approached the
linguistic omniscience of Mezzofanti; but, like Mezzofanti, Dr
Malan was more of a linguist than a critic. He made himself conspicuous
by the vehemence of his opposition to Westcott and
Hort&rsquo;s text of the New Testament, and to the transliteration
of Oriental languages, on neither of which points did he in general
obtain the suffrages of scholars. His extensive and valuable
library, some special collections excepted, was presented by him
in his lifetime to the Indian Institute at Oxford. He died at
Bournemouth on the 25th of November 1894. His life has been
written by his son.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MÄLAR,<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span> a lake of Sweden, extending 73 m. westward from
Stockholm, which lies at its junction with the Saltsjö, an arm of
the Baltic Sea. The height of the lake is normally only from 11 in.
to 2 ft. above sea-level, and its outflow is sometimes reversed.
The area is 449 sq. m. The bottom consists of a series of basins
separate by ridges from which rise numerous islands. The
deepest sounding is 210 ft. The outline is very irregular, the
mean breadth being about 15 m., but an arm extends northward
for 30 m. nearly to the city of Upsala with many ramifications.
The area of the drainage basin is 8789 sq. m., of which 1124
are occupied by lakes. The navigable connexions with the lake
are&mdash;(1) with lake Hjelmar to the south-west by the Arboga
river and the Hjelmar canal; and by the Eskilstuna river and
the Thorshälla canal; (2) with the Baltic southward through
the Södertelge canal, the route followed by the Göta canal
steamers; (3) with the Baltic by two channels at Stockholm.
The more important towns, besides Stockholm, are Vesterås on
the north, Södertelge and Eskilstuna near the south shore.
The lake offers a field for recreation fully appreciated by the
inhabitants of the capital, and many of those whose business
lies at Stockholm have their residences on the shores of Mälar.
On Drottningholm (Queen&rsquo;s Island, named from Catherine, wife
of John III.) is a palace with a fine park and formal gardens.
John III. built a palace at the close of the 16th century, but the
existing building, by Nicodemus Tessin and his son Nicodemus,
dates from the second half of the 17th century. At Mariefred
on the south shore there is the castle of Gripsholm (1537), built
by Gustavus Vasa, a picturesque erection with four towers,
richly adorned within, and containing a large collection of
portraits. Strengnäs, on the same shore, became an episcopal
see in 1291, when the fine cathedral, much altered since, was
consecrated. In the episcopal palace, a building of the 15th
century now used as a school, Gustavus Vasa was elected to the
throne of Sweden in 1523. On the northward arm of the lake
is the palace of Rosenberg, used as a school of gunnery, in a well-wooded
park. On a branch of the same arm is Sigtuna, a village
whose ruined churches are a memorial of its rank among the
principal towns of Sweden after its foundation in the 11th century.
Remains prove that on Björkö, an island in the eastern
part of the lake, there was a large settlement of earlier importance
than Sigtuna. Here a cross commemorates the preaching of
Christianity by St Ansgar in 829. Finally, on the northern arm
about 10 m. south of Upsala, there is the château of Skokloster,
occupying the site of a monastery, and presented by Gustavus
Adolphus to Marshal Herman Wrangel, whose son Charles
Gustavus Wrangel stored it with a remarkable collection of
trophies from Germany, taken during the Thirty Years&rsquo; War;
including a library, an armoury, and a great accumulation of
curios.</p>

fever, jungle fever, hill fever, &ldquo;fever of the country&rdquo; and &ldquo;fever
and ague.&rdquo; A single paroxysm of simple ague may come upon
the patient in the midst of good health or it may be preceded
by some malaise. The ague-fit begins with chills proceeding as if
from the lower part of the back, and gradually extending until
the coldness overtakes the whole body. Tremors of the muscles
more or less violent accompany the cold sensations, beginning
with the muscles of the lower jaw (chattering of the teeth), and
extending to the extremities and trunk. The expression has
meanwhile changed: the face is pale or livid; there are dark rings
under the eyes; the features are pinched and sharp, and the
whole skin shrunken; the fingers are dead white, the nails
blue.</p>

<p>All those symptoms are referable to spasmodic constriction of
the small surface arteries, the pulse at the wrist being itself
small, hard and quick. In the interior organs there are indications
of a compensating accumulation of blood, such as swelling
of the spleen, engorgement (very rarely rupture) of the heart,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page462" id="page462"></a>462</span>
with a feeling of oppression in the chest, and a copious flow of
clear and watery urine from the congested kidneys. The body
temperature will have risen suddenly from the normal to 103° or
higher. This first or cold stage of the paroxysm varies much in
length; in temperate climates it lasts from one to two hours,
while in tropical and subtropical countries it may be shortened.
It is followed by the stage of dry heat, which will be prolonged in
proportion as the previous stage is curtailed. The feeling of
heat is at first an internal one, but it spreads outwards to the
surface and to the extremities; the skin becomes warm and red,
but remains dry; the pulse becomes softer and more full, but
still quick; and the throbbings occur in exposed arteries, such as
the temporal. The spleen continues to enlarge; the urine is now
scanty and high-coloured; the body temperature is high, but the
highest temperatures occur during the chill; there is considerable
thirst; and there is the usual intellectual unfitness, and it
may be confusion, of the feverish state. This period of dry heat,
having lasted three or four hours or longer, comes to an end in
perspiration, at first a mere moistness of the skin, passing into
sweating that may be profuse and even drenching. Sleep may
overtake the patient in the midst of the sweating stage, and he
awakes, not without some feeling of what he has passed through,
but on the whole well, with the temperature fallen almost or
altogether to the normal, or it may be even below the normal;
the pulse moderate and full; the spleen again of its ordinary size;
the urine that is passed after the paroxysm deposits a thick
brick-red sediment of urates. The three stages together will
probably have lasted six to twelve hours. The paroxysm is
followed by a definite interval in which there is not only no
fever, but even a fair degree of bodily comfort and fitness; this
is the intermission of the fever. Another paroxysm begins at
or near the same hour next day (quotidian ague), which results
from a double tertian infection, or the interval may be forty-eight
hours (tertian ague), or seventy-two hours (quartan
ague). It is the general rule, with frequent exceptions, that the
quotidian paroxysm comes on in the morning, the tertian about
noon, and the quartan in the afternoon. Another rule is that
the quartan has the longest cold stage, while its paroxysm is
shortest as a whole; the quotidian has the shortest cold stage and
a long hot stage, while its paroxysm is longest as a whole. The
point common to the various forms of ague is that the
paroxysm ceases about midnight or early morning. Quotidian
intermittent is on the whole more common than tertian in
hot countries; elsewhere the tertian is the usual type, and
quartan is only occasional.</p>

<p>If the first paroxysm should not cease within the twenty-four
hours, the fever is not reckoned as an intermittent, but as a
remittent.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Remittent</i> is a not unusual form of the malarial process in tropical
and subtropical countries, and in some localities or in some seasons
it is more common than intermittent. It may be said to arise out
of that type of intermittent in which the cold stage is shortened while
the hot stage tends to be prolonged. A certain abatement or remission
of the fever takes place, with or without sweating, but
there is no true intermission or interval of absolute apyrexia. The
periodicity shows itself in the form of an exacerbation of the still
continuing fever, and that exacerbation may take place twenty-four
hours after the first onset, or the interval may be only half
that period, or it may be double. A fever that is to be remittent
will usually declare itself from the outset: it begins with chills, but
without the shivering and shaking fit of the intermittent; the hot
stage soon follows, presenting the same characters as the prolonged
hot stage of the quotidian, with the frequent addition of bilious
symptoms, and it may be even of jaundice and of tenderness over
the stomach and liver. Towards morning the fever abates; the
pulse falls in frequency, but does not come down to the normal;
headache and aching in the loins and limbs become less, but do not
cease altogether; the body temperature falls, but does not touch the
level of apyrexia. The remission or abatement lasts generally
throughout the morning; and about noon there is an exacerbation,
seldom ushered in by chills, which continues till the early morning
following, when it remits or abates as before. A patient with
remittent may get well in a week under treatment, but the fever
may go on for several weeks; the return to health is often announced
by the fever assuming the intermittent type, or, in other words, by
the remissions touching the level of absolute apyrexia. Remittent
fevers (as well as intermittents) vary considerably in intensity;
some cases are intense from the outset, or pernicious, with aggravation
of all the symptoms&mdash;leading to stupor, delirium, collapse,
intense jaundice, blood in the stools, blood and albumen in the
urine, and, it may be, suppression of urine followed by convulsions.
The severe forms of intermittent are most apt to occur in the very
young, or in the aged, or in debilitated persons generally. Milder
cases of malarial fever are apt to become dangerous from the
complications of dysentery, bronchitis or pneumonia. Severe
remittents (pernicious or bilious remittents) approximate to the
type of yellow fever (<i>q.v.</i>), which is conventionally limited to epidemic
outbreaks in western longitudes and on the west coast of
Africa.</p>
</div>

<p>Of the mortality due to malarial disease a small part
only is referable to the direct attack of intermittent, and chiefly
to the fever in its pernicious form. Remittent fever is much
more fatal in its direct attack. But probably the greater
part of the enormous total of deaths set down to malaria is
due to the <i>malarial cachexia</i>. The dwellers in a malarious
region like the Terai (at the foot of the Himalayas) are miserable,
listless and ugly, with large heads and particularly prominent
ears, flat noses, tumid bellies, slender limbs and sallow complexions;
the children are impregnated with malaria from
their birth, and their growth is attended with aberrations
from the normal which practically amount to the disease of
rickets. The malarial cachexia that follows definite attacks
of ague consists in a state of ill-defined suffering, associated
with a sallow skin, enlarged spleen and liver, and sometimes
with dropsy.</p>

<p><i>Causation.</i>&mdash;From the time of Hippocrates onwards the
malarial or periodical fevers have engaged the attention of
innumerable observers, who have suggested various theories
of causation, and have sometimes anticipated&mdash;vaguely,
indeed, but with surprising accuracy&mdash;the results of modern
research; but the true nature of the disease remained in doubt
until the closing years of the 19th century. It has now been
demonstrated by a series of accurate investigations, contributed
by many workers, that malaria is caused by a microscopic
parasite in the blood, into which it is introduced by the bites
of certain species of mosquito. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Parasitic Diseases</a></span>
and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mosquitoes</a></span>.)</p>

<p>The successive steps by which the present position has been
reached form an interesting chapter in the history of scientific
progress. The first substantial link in the actual
chain of discovery was contributed in 1880 by
<span class="sidenote">History of Discovery.</span>
Laveran, a French army surgeon serving in Algeria.
On the 6th of November in that year he plainly saw the living
parasites under the microscope in the blood of a malarial patient,
and he shortly afterwards communicated his observations to the
Paris Académie de Médecine. They were confirmed, but met with
little acceptance in the scientific world, which was preoccupied
with the claims of a subsequently discredited Bacillus malariae.
In 1885 the Italian pathologists came round to Laveran&rsquo;s views,
and began to work out the life history of his parasites. The
subject has a special interest for Italy, which is devastated by
malaria, and Italian science has contributed materially to
the solution of the problem. The labours of Golgi, Marchiafava,
Celli and others established the nature of the parasite and
its behaviour in the blood; they proved the fact, guessed by
Rasori so far back as 1846, that the periodical febrile paroxysm
corresponds with the development of the organisms; and they
showed that the different forms of malarial fever have their
distinct parasites, and consequently fall into distinct groups,
defined on an etiological as well as a clinical basis&mdash;namely,
the mild or spring group, which includes tertian and quartan
ague, and the malignant or &ldquo;aestivo-autumnal&rdquo; group, which
includes a tertian or a semi-tertian and the true quotidian
type. Three distinct parasites, corresponding with the tertian,
quartan and malignant types of fever, have been described
by Italian observers, and the classification is generally accepted;
intermediate types are ascribed to mixed and multiple infections.
So far, however, only half the problem, and from the practical
point of view the less important half, had been solved. The
origin of the parasite and its mode of introduction into
the blood remained to be discovered. An old popular belief
current in different countries, and derived from common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page463" id="page463"></a>463</span>
observation, connected mosquitoes with malaria, and from time
to time this theory found support in more scientific quarters
on general grounds, but it lacked demonstration and attracted
little attention. In 1894, however, Sir Patrick Manson, arguing
with greater precision by analogy from his own discovery of
the cause of filariasis and the part played by mosquitoes,
suggested that the malarial parasite had a similar intermediate
host outside the human body, and that a suctorial insect,
which would probably be found to be a particular mosquito,
was required for its development. Following up this line
of investigation, Major Ronald Ross in 1895 found that if a
mosquito sucked blood containing the parasites they soon
began to throw out flagellae, which broke away and became
free; and in 1897 he discovered peculiar pigmented cells, which
afterwards turned out to be the parasites of aestivo-autumnal
malaria in an early stage of development, within the stomach-wall
of mosquitoes which had been fed on malarial blood.
He further found that only mosquitoes of the genus <i>Anopheles</i>
had these cells, and that they did not get them when fed on
healthy blood. Then, turning his attention to the malaria
of birds, he worked out the life-history of these cells within
the body of the mosquito. &ldquo;He saw that they increased in
size, divided, and became full of filiform spores, then ruptured
and poured out their multitudinous progeny into the body-cavity
of their insect host. Finally, he saw the spores accumulate
within the cells of the salivary glands, and discovered
that they actually passed down the salivary ducts and along
the grooved hypopharynx into the seat of puncture, thus
causing infection in a fresh vertebrate host&rdquo; (Sambon). To
apply these discoveries to the malaria of man was an obvious
step. In working out the details the Italian school have again
taken a prominent part.</p>

<p>Thus we get a complete scientific demonstration of the
causation of malaria in three stages: (1) the discovery of the
parasite by Laveran; (2) its life-history in the human host and
connexion with the fever demonstrated by the Italian observers;
(3) its life-history in the alternate host, and the identification
of the latter with a particular species of mosquito by Ross
and Manson. The conclusions derived from the microscopical
laboratory were confirmed by actual experiment. In 1898
<span class="sidenote">Experiment.</span>
it was conclusively shown in Italy that if a mosquito
of the <i>Anopheles</i> variety bites a person suffering
from malaria, and is kept long enough for the parasite to develop
in the salivary gland, and is then allowed to bite a healthy
person, the latter will in due time develop malaria. The converse
proposition, that persons efficiently protected from
mosquito bites escape malaria, has been made the subject of
several remarkable experiments. One of the most interesting
was carried out in 1900 for the London School of Tropical
Medicine by Dr Sambon and Dr Low, who went to reside in
one of the most malarious districts in the Roman Campagna
during the most dangerous season. Together with Signor
Terzi and two Italian servants, they lived from the beginning
of July until the 19th of October in a specially protected hut,
erected near Ostia. The sole precaution taken was to confine
themselves between sunset and sunrise to their mosquito-proof
dwelling. All escaped malaria, which was rife in the
immediate neighbourhood. Mosquitoes caught by the experimenters,
and sent to London, produced malaria in persons
who submitted themselves to the bites of these insects at the
London School of Tropical Medicine. Experiments in protection
on a larger scale, and under more ordinary conditions,
have been carried out with equal success by Professor Celli
and other Italian authorities. The first of these was in 1899,
and the subjects were the railwaymen employed on certain
lines running through highly malarious districts. Of 24 protected
persons, all escaped but four, and these had to be out
at night or otherwise neglected precautions; of 38 unprotected
persons, all contracted malaria except two, who had apparently
acquired immunity. In 1900 further experiments gave still
better results. Of 52 protected persons on one line, all escaped
except two, who were careless; of 52 protected on another
line, all escaped; while of 51 unprotected persons, living in
alternate houses, all suffered except seven. Out of a total of
207 persons protected in these railway experiments, 197 escaped.
In two peasants&rsquo; cottages in the Campagna, protected with
wire netting by Professor Celli, all the inmates&mdash;10 in number&mdash;escaped,
while the neighbours suffered severely; and three
out of four persons living in a third hut, from which protection
was removed owing to the indifference of the inmates, contracted
malaria. In the malarious islet of Asinara a pond
of stagnant water was treated with petroleum and all windows
were protected with gauze. The result was that the houses
were free from mosquitoes and no malaria occurred throughout
the entire season, though there had been 40 cases in the previous
year. Eight Red Cross ambulances, each with a doctor
and attendant, were sent into the most malarious parts of the
Campagna in 1900. By living in protected houses and wearing
gloves and veils at night all the staff escaped malaria except
one or two attendants. These and other experiments, described
by Dr Manson in the <i>Practitioner</i> for March 1900, confirming
the laboratory evidence as they do, leave no doubt
whatever of the correctness of the mosquito-parasitic theory
of malaria.</p>

<p>It is possible, though not probable, that malaria may also
be contracted in some other way than by mosquito bite, but
there are no well-authenticated facts which require any other
theory for their explanation. The alleged occurrence of the
disease in localities free from mosquitoes or without their
agency is not well attested; its absence from other localities
where they abound is accounted for by their being of an innocent
species, or&mdash;as in England&mdash;free from the parasite. The old
theory of paludism or of a noxious miasma exhaled from the
ground is no longer necessary. The broad facts on which it is
based are sufficiently accounted for by the habits of mosquitoes.
For instance, the swampy character of malarial areas is explained
by their breeding in stagnant water; the effect of drainage,
and the general immunity of high-lying, dry localities, by the
lack of breeding facilities; the danger of the night air, by their
nocturnal habits; the comparative immunity of the upper
storeys of houses, by the fact that they fly low; the confinement
of malaria to well-marked areas and the diminution of danger
with distance, by their habit of clinging to the breeding-grounds
and not flying far. Similarly, the subsidence of malaria during
cold weather and its seasonal prevalence find an adequate
explanation in the conditions governing insect life. At the
same time it should be remembered that many points await
elucidation, and it is unwise to assume conclusions in advance
of the evidence.</p>

<p>With regard to the parasites, which are the actual cause
of malaria in man, an account of them is given under the heading
of <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Parasitic Diseases</a></span>, and little need be said about
them here. They belong to the group of Protozoa,
<span class="sidenote">Parasites.</span>
and, as already explained, have a double cycle of existence:
(1) a sexual cycle in the body of the mosquito, (2) an asexual
cycle in the blood of human beings. They occupy and destroy
the red corpuscles, converting the haemoglobin into melanin;
they multiply in the blood by sporulation, and produce accessions
of fever by the liberation of a toxin at the time of sporulation
(Ross). The number in the blood in an acute attack is
reckoned by Ross to be not less than 250 millions. A more
general and practical interest attaches to the insects which
act as their intermediate hosts. These mosquitoes or gnats&mdash;the
terms are synonymous&mdash;belong to the family <i>Culicidae</i>
and the genus <i>Anopheles</i>, which was first classified by Meigen
in 1818. It has a wide geographical distribution, being found
in Europe (including England), Asia Minor, Burma, Straits
Settlements, Java, China, Formosa, Egypt; west, south
and Central Africa; Australia, South America, West Indies,
United States and Canada, but is generally confined to local
centres in those countries. About fifty species are recognized
at present. It is believed that all of them may serve as hosts
of the parasite. The species best known in connexion with
malaria are <i>A. maculipennis</i> (Europe and America), <i>A. funestus</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page464" id="page464"></a>464</span>
and <i>A. costales</i> (Africa). In colour <i>Anopheles</i> is usually brownish
or slaty, but sometimes buff, and the thorax frequently has
a dark stripe on each side. The wings in nearly all species
have a dappled or speckled appearance, owing to the occurrence
of blotches on the front margin and to the arrangement of
the scales covering the veins in alternating light and dark
patches (Austen). The genus with which <i>Anopheles</i> is most
likely to be confounded is <i>Culex</i>, which is the commonest of
all mosquitoes, has a world-wide distribution, and is generally
a greedy blood-sucker. A distinctive feature is the position
assumed in resting; <i>Culex</i> has a humpbacked attitude, while
in <i>Anopheles</i> the proboscis, head and body are in a straight
line, and in many species inclined at an angle to the wall, the
tail sticking outwards. In the female of <i>Culex</i> the palpi are
much shorter than the proboscis; in <i>Anopheles</i> they are of the
same length. The wings in <i>Culex</i> have not the same dappled
appearance. <i>Anopheles</i> is also a more slender insect, with a
smaller head, narrower body and thinner legs. There are
further differences in the other stages of life. Mosquitoes
go through four phases: (1) ovum, (2) larva, (3) nympha, (4)
complete insect. The ova of <i>Anopheles</i> are tiny black rod-shaped
objects, which are deposited on the water of natural
puddles, ponds, or slowly moving streams, by preference those
which are well supplied with vegetation; they float, singly
or attached to other objects or clustered together in patterns.
They can live in brackish and even in sea water. The larva
has no breathing-tube, and floats horizontally at the surface,
except when feeding; it does not frequent sewage or foul water.
The ova of <i>Culex</i>, on the other hand, are deposited in any
stagnant water, including cesspools, drains, cisterns, or water
collected in any vessel; they float in boat-shaped masses on
the surface. The larva has a breathing-tube, and floats head
downwards; when disturbed it wriggles to the bottom (Christy).
Some observers maintain that <i>Anopheles</i> does not &ldquo;sing,&rdquo;
like the common mosquito, and its bite is much less irritating.
Only the females suck blood; the act is believed to be necessary
for fertilization and reproduction. <i>Anopheles</i> rarely bites
by day, and then only in dark places. In the daytime &ldquo;the
gorged females rest motionless on the walls and ceilings of
rooms, choosing always the darkest situations for this purpose&rdquo;
(Austen). In temperate climates the impregnated females
hibernate during the winter in houses, cellars, stables, the
trunks of trees, &amp;c., coming out to lay their eggs in the spring.
The four phases are passed in thirty days in a favourable
season, and consequently there are ordinarily four or five
generations from April to September (Celli).</p>

<p>The most important question raised by the mosquito-parasitic
theory of malaria is that of prevention. This may
be considered under two heads: (1) individual prophylaxis;
(2) administrative prevention on a large scale.</p>

<p>(1) In the first place, common sense suggests the avoidance,
in malarious countries, of unhealthy situations, and particularly
the neighbourhood of stagnant water. Among
elements of unhealthiness is next to be reckoned
<span class="sidenote">Prophylaxis.</span>
the proximity of native villages, the inhabitants
of which are infected. In the tropics &ldquo;no European house
should be located nearer to a native village than half a mile&rdquo;
(Manson), and, since children are almost universally infected,
&ldquo;the presence of young natives in the house should be absolutely
interdicted&rdquo; (Manson). When unhealthy situations
cannot be avoided, they may be rendered more healthy by
destroying the breeding-grounds of mosquitoes in the neighbourhood.
All puddles and collections of water should be
filled in or drained; as a temporary expedient they may be
treated with petroleum, which prevents the development
of the larvae. When a place cannot be kept free from mosquitoes
the house may be protected, as in the experiments in
Italy, by wire gauze at the doors and windows. The arrangement
used for the entrance is a wire cage with double doors.
Failing such protection mosquito curtains should be used.
Mosquitoes in the house may be destroyed by the fumes of
burning sulphur or tobacco smoke. According to the experiments
of Celli and Casagrandi, these are the most effective
culicides; when used in sufficient quantity they kill mosquitoes
in one minute. The same authorities recommend a powder,
composed of larvicide (an aniline substance), chrysanthemum
flowers, and valerian root, to be burnt in bedrooms. Anointing
the skin with strong-smelling substances is of little use
in the open air, but more effective in the house; turpentine
appears to be the best. Exposure at night should be avoided.
All these prophylactic measures are directed against mosquitoes.
There remains the question of protection against
the parasite. Chills are recognized as predisposing both to
primary infection and to relapses, and malnutrition is also
believed to increase susceptibility; both should therefore be
avoided. Then a certain amount of immunity may be acquired
by the systematic use of quinine. Manson recommends five
to ten grains once or twice a week; Ross recommends the same
quantity every day before breakfast. There is some evidence
that arsenic has a prophylactic effect. An experiment made
on the railway staff at Bovino, a highly malarious district
on the Adriatic, gave a striking result. The number of persons
was 78, and they were divided into two equal groups of 39 each.
One group was treated with arsenic, and of these 36 escaped
altogether, while three had mild attacks; the remaining 39
who were not treated, all had fever. In a more extended
experiment on 657 railwaymen 402 escaped. This was in
1889; but in spite of the encouraging results the use of arsenic
does not appear to have made any further progress. Experiments
in immunizing by sero-therapeutic methods have not
as yet met with success.</p>

<p>(2) Much attention has been directed in scientific circles
to the possibility of &ldquo;stamping out&rdquo; epidemic malaria by
administrative measures. The problem is one
of great practical importance, especially to the
<span class="sidenote">Administrative Measures.</span>
British Empire. There are no data for estimating
the damage inflicted by malaria in the British colonies.
It is, indeed, quite incalculable. In Italy the annual mortality
from this cause averages 15,000, which is estimated
to represent two million cases of sickness and a consequent
loss of several million francs. In British tropical possessions
the bill is incomparably heavier. There is not only the
heavy toll in life and health exacted from Europeans, but
the virtual closing of enormous tracts of productive country
which would otherwise afford scope for British enterprise.
The &ldquo;deadly&rdquo; climates, to which so much dread attaches,
generally mean malaria, and the mastery of this disease would
be equivalent to the addition of vast and valuable areas to
the empire. The problem, therefore, is eminently one for the
statesman and administrator. A solution may be sought
in several directions, suggested by the facts already explained.
The existence of the parasite is maintained by a vicious interchange
between its alternate hosts, mosquitoes and man,
each infecting the other. If the cycle be broken at any point
the parasite must die out, assuming that it has no other origin
or mode of existence. The most effective step would obviously
be the extermination of the <i>Anopheles</i> mosquito. A great
deal may be done towards this end by suppressing their breeding-places,
which means the drying of the ground. It is a
question for the engineer, and may require different methods
in different circumstances. Put comprehensively, it involves
the control of the subsoil and surface waters by drainage,
the regulation of rivers and floods, suitable agriculture, the
clearing of forests or jungles, which tend to increase the rainfall
and keep the ground swampy.</p>

<p>The city of Rome is an example of what can be done by
drainage; situated in the midst of malaria, it is itself quite
healthy. Recent reports also show us how much may be
done in infected districts. At Ismailia malaria was reduced
from 1551 cases in 1902 to 37 cases in 1905. The cost of operations
amounted to an initial expenditure of 6.25 francs, and
an annual expenditure of about 2.3 francs per head of the
population. &ldquo;The results are due to mosquito reduction
together with cinchonization.&rdquo; The following is a tabulated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page465" id="page465"></a>465</span>
list of the cases. The population of Ismailia is about 6000.</p>

<p>A systematic campaign for the destruction of breeding-places
has been inaugurated in the British West African colonies,
with encouraging results. The planting of eucalyptus trees
is out of favour at present, but it appears to have been successful
in Portugal, not from any prophylactic virtues in the plant,
but through the great absorption of moisture by its deep roots,
which tends to dry the subsoil. Treating the breeding-ponds
with petroleum or similar preparations seems to be hardly
applicable on a large scale, and in any case can only be a temporary
expedient. H. Ziemann advocates the destruction of
mosquito larvae by the growing of such plants as the water-pest
(<i>Anacharis alsinatrum</i>) which covers the surface of the
water and suffocates larvae and nymphae. Short of suppressing
mosquitoes, the parasitic cycle may theoretically be broken
by preventing them from giving the infection to man or taking
it from him. The means of accomplishing the former have
been already pointed out, but they are obviously difficult
to carry out on a large scale, particularly in native communities.
It is one thing to protect individuals from mosquito bites,
another to prevent the propagation of the parasite in a whole
community. Perhaps the converse is more feasible in some
circumstances&mdash;that is to say, preventing mosquitoes from
having access to malarial persons, and so propagating the
parasite in themselves. It could be carried out where the
infected persons are few, by isolating and protecting them,
but not where many are infected, as in native villages. Koch
has suggested that the disinfection of malarial persons by
quinine would have the desired effect, but other authorities
of greater experience do not consider it practicable. In spite
of the difficulties, however, there is no doubt that a great
deal can be done to reduce, if not stamp out, malaria by the
methods indicated, which should be applied according to
circumstances. An encouraging example is afforded by the
remarkable fact that malaria, which was once rife in certain
districts of England, has now died out, although the <i>Anopheles
maculipennis</i> mosquito still exists there. The parasitic cycle
has been broken, and the insect is no longer infected. The
suggested causes are (1) reduction of insects by drainage, (2)
reduced population, (3) the use of quinine. Sir Patrick Manson
has suggested that the problem of stamping out malaria may
be assisted by the discovery of some at present unknown factors.
He has pointed out that certain areas and certain islands are
entirely free from the disease, while neighbouring areas and
islands are devastated. This immunity is apparently not
due to the absence of favourable conditions, but rather to the
presence of some inimical factor which prevents the development
of the parasite. If this factor could be discovered it
might be applied to the suppression of the disease in malarious
localities.</p>

<p>A few other points may be noted. The pathological changes
in malaria are due to the deposition of melanin and the detritus
of red corpuscles and haemoglobin, and to the congregation of
parasites in certain sites (Ross). In chronic cases the eventual
effects are anaemia, melanosis, enlargement of the spleen and
liver, and general cachexia. Apparently the parasites may
remain quiescent in the blood for years and may cause relapses
by fresh sporulation. Recent discoveries have done little
or nothing for treatment. Quinine still remains the one
specific. In serious cases it should not be given in solid form,
but in solution by the stomach, rectum, or&mdash;better&mdash;hypodermically
(Manson). According to Ross, it should be given
promptly, in sufficient doses (up to 30 grains), and should be
continued for months. Euquinine is by some preferred to
quinine, but it is more expensive. Nucleogen and Aristochin
have also been recommended instead of quinine. The nature
of immunity is not known. Some persons are naturally absolutely
immune (Celli), but this is rare; immunity is also sometimes
acquired by infection, but as a rule persons once infected
are more predisposed than others. Races inhabiting malarious
districts acquire a certain degree of resistance, no doubt through
natural selection. Children are much more susceptible than
adults.</p>

<p><i>Malaria in the Lower Vertebrates.</i>&mdash;Birds are subject to
malaria, which is caused by blood parasites akin to those in
man and having a similar life-history. Two species, affecting
different kinds of birds, have been identified. Their alternate
hosts are mosquitoes of the <i>Culex</i> genus. Oxen, sheep, dogs,
monkeys, bats, and probably horses also suffer from similar
parasitic diseases. In the case of oxen the alternate host
of the parasite is a special tick (Smith and Kilborne). In
the other animals several parasites have been described by different
observers, but the alternate hosts are not known.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALATIA<a name="ar117" id="ar117"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Malatieh</span> or <span class="sc">Aspuzu</span>) the chief town of a sanjak
of the same name in the Mamuret el-Aziz vilayet of Asia
Minor, and a military station on the Samsun-Sivas-Diarbekr
road, altitude 2900 ft., situated about 10 m. S.W. of the junction
of the Tokhma Su (med. Kubak&#299;b) with the Euphrates, near
the south end of a fertile plain, and at the northern foot of the
Taurus. Pop. about 30,000, including, besides many Armenian
Christians, bodies of Kurds and &ldquo;Kizilbash.&rdquo; It is a wholly
modern place, rebuilt since the earthquake of 1893, contains
fine public buildings, and is noted for its fruit orchards. There
are Protestant (American) and Roman Catholic missions, and
an Armenian Catholic archbishop has his seat here. Eskishehr
or Old Malatia (<i>Melitene</i>), 5 m. N.E. and 3 m. from the
great medieval bridge (Kirkgeuz) over the Tokhma Su, is said
to owe its present desolation largely to its occupation by Hafiz
Pasha as his headquarters in 1838 before his advance to fight
the disastrous battle of Nizib with the Egyptian, Ibrahim.
But it has still many inhabitants and large gardens and many
ruinous mosques, baths, &amp;c., relics of Mansur&rsquo;s city. It was
the residence of von Moltke for some months, while attached
to Hafiz&rsquo;s army. The earliest site was possibly Arslan Tepe
about 2 m. south of Eskishehr were two &ldquo;Hittite&rdquo; stelae,
representing hunting scenes, now in the Constantinople and
Paris museums, were found in 1894.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In the time of Strabo (xii. 537) there was no town in the district
of Melitene, which was reckoned part of Cappadocia. Under Titus
the place became the permanent station of the 12th (&ldquo;Thundering&rdquo;)
legion; Trajan raised it to a city. Lying in a very fertile country
at the crossing point of important routes, including the Persian
&ldquo;Royal Road,&rdquo; and two imperial military highways from Caesarea
and along the Euphrates bank, it grew in size and importance, and
was the capital of Armenia Minor or Secunda. Justinian, who
completed the walls commenced by Anastasius, made it the capital
of Armenia Tertia; it was then a very great place (Procop., <i>De aed.</i>,
iii. 4). The town was burnt by Chosroes on his retreat after his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page466" id="page466"></a>466</span>
great defeat there in 577. Taken by the Saracens, retaken and
destroyed by Constantine Copronymus, it was presently recovered
to Islam, and rebuilt under Mansur (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 756). It again changed
hands more than once, being reckoned among the frontier towns of
Syria (Istakhry, pp. 55, 62). At length the Greeks recovered it in
934, and Nicephorus II., finding the district much wasted, encouraged
the Jacobites to settle in it, which they did in great numbers. A
convent of the Virgin, and the great church which bears his name,
were erected by the bishop Ignatius (Isaac the Runner). From
this time Malatia continued to be a great seat of the Jacobites, and
it was the birthplace of their famous maphrian Barhebraeus (or
Abulfaragius). At the commencement of the 11th century the
population was said to number 60,000 fighting men (Assem., <i>Bib.
Or.</i>, ii. 149; cf. Barheb., <i>Chr. Eccl.</i>, i. 411, 423). At the time of
the first crusade, the city, being hard pressed by the Turks under
Ibn Danishmend, was relieved by Baldwin, after Bohemund had
failed and lost his liberty in the attempt. But the Jacobites had
no cause to love Byzantium, and the Greek governor Gabriel was
so cruel and faithless that the townsmen were soon glad to open
their gates to Ibn Danishmend (1102), and the city subsequently
became part of the realm of Kilij Arslan, sultan of Iconium.</p>

<i>Indian Archipelago</i>, the <i>East Indies</i>, <i>Indonesia</i>, <i>Insulinde</i>), the
largest group of islands in the world, lying south-east of Asia and
north and north-west of Australia. It includes the Sunda Islands,

through the middle of the archipelago; it successively cuts
Sumatra, Borneo, Celebes and Halmahera, four of the most
important islands. A. R. Wallace (who includes the Solomon
Islands as well as New Guinea in the group) points out that the
archipelago &ldquo;includes two islands larger than Great Britain;
and in one of them, Borneo, the whole of the British Isles might
be set down, and would be surrounded by a sea of forests.
Sumatra is about equal in extent to Great Britain; Java, Luzon,
and Celebes are each about the size of Ireland. Eighteen more
islands are on the average as large as Jamaica; and more than
a hundred are as large as the Isle of Wight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The islands of the archipelago nearly all present bold and
picturesque profiles against the horizon, and at the same time the
character of the scenery varies from island to island and even
from district to district. The mountains are arranged for the
most part in lines running either from north-west to south-east
or from west to east. In Sumatra and in the islands between
Sumatra and Borneo the former direction is distinctly marked,
and the latter is equally noticeable in Java and the other southern
islands. The mountains of Borneo, however, rise rather in short
ridges and clusters. Nothing in the general physiognomy of the
islands is more remarkable than the number and distribution of
the volcanoes, active or extinct. Running south-east through
Sumatra, east through Java and the southern islands to Timor,
curving north through the Moluccas, and again north, from
the end of Celebes through the whole line of the Philippines, they
follow a line roughly resembling a horseshoe narrowed towards
the point. The loftiest mountain in the archipelago would
appear to be Kinabalu in Borneo (13,698 ft.). An important
fact in the physical geography of the archipelago is that Java,
Bali, Sumatra and Borneo, and the lesser islands between them
and the Asiatic mainland, all rest on a great submerged bank,
nowhere more than 100 fathoms below sea-level, which may be
considered a continuation of the continent; while to the east the
depth of the sea has been found at various places to be from 1000
to 2500 fathoms. As the value of this fact was particularly
emphasized by Wallace, the limit of the shallow water, which is
found in the narrow but deep channel between Bali and Lombok,
and strikes north to the east of Borneo, has received the name of
&ldquo;Wallace&rsquo;s Line.&rdquo; The Philippines on the other hand, &ldquo;are
almost surrounded by deep sea, but are connected with Borneo by
means of two narrow submarine banks&rdquo; (A. R. Wallace, <i>Island
Life</i>). The archipelago, in effect, is divided between two great
regions, the Asiatic and the Australian, and the fact is evident
in various branches of its geography&mdash;zoological, botanical,
and even human. It is believed that there was a land-connexion
between Asia and Australia in the later part of the
Secondary epoch, and that the Australian continent, when
separated, became divided into islands before the south-eastern
part of the Asiatic did so.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The most notable fact in the geological history of the archipelago
is the discovery in Java of the fossil remains of <i>Pithecanthropus
erectus</i>, a form intermediate between the higher apes and man.
In its structure and cranial capacity it is entitled to a higher place
in the zoological scale than any anthropoid, for it almost certainly
walked erect; and, on the other hand, in its intellectual powers it
must have been much below the lowest of the human race at present
known. The strata in which it was found belong to the Miocene or
Upper Pliocene. Among the rocks of economic importance may
be mentioned granite of numerous kinds, syenite, serpentine,
porphyry, marble, sandstones and marls. Coal is worked in
Sumatra, Borneo and Labuan. Diamonds are obtained in Borneo,
garnets in Sumatra, Bachian and Timor, and topazes in Bachian,
antimony in Borneo and the Philippines; lead in Sumatra, Borneo
and the Philippines; copper and malachite in the Philippines,
Timor, Borneo and Sumatra; and, most important of all, tin in
Banka, Billiton and Singkep. Iron is pretty frequent in various
forms. Gold is not uncommon in the older ranges of Sumatra,
Banka, Celebes, Bachian, Timor and Borneo. Manganese could be
readily worked in Timor, where it lies in the Carboniferous Limestone.
Platinum is found in Landak and other parts of Borneo.
Petroleum is a valuable product of Sumatra and Java, and is also
found in Borneo.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Climate</i>, <i>Flora</i>, <i>Fauna</i>.&mdash;The most striking general fact as
regards climate in the archipelago is that wherever that part of
the south-east monsoon which has passed over Australia strikes,
the climate is comparatively dry, and the vegetation is less
luxuriant. The east end of Java, <i>e.g.</i> has a less rainfall than the
west; the distribution of the rain on the north coast is quite
different from that on the south, and a similar difference is
observed between the east and the west of Celebes. The north-west
monsoon, beginning in October and lasting till March, brings
the principal rainy season in the archipelago.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Most of the islands of the archipelago belong to the great equatorial
forest-belt. In its economical aspect the vegetation, whether
natural or cultivated, is of prime interest. The list of fruits is very
extensive, though few of them are widely known. These, however,
include the orange, mango, mangosteen, shaddock, guava
and the durian. The variety of food-plants is equally notable.
Not only are rice and maize, sugar and coffee, among the widely
cultivated crops, but the coco-nut, the bread-fruit, the banana
and plantain, the sugar-palm, the tea-plant, the sago-palm, the
coco-tree, the ground-nut, the yam, the cassava, and others besides,
are of practical importance. The cultivation of sugar and coffee
owes its development mainly to the Dutch; and to them also is due
the introduction of tea. They have greatly encouraged the cultivation
of the coco-nut among the natives, and it flourishes, especially
in the coast districts, in almost every island in their territory.
The oil is largely employed in native cookery. Pepper, nutmegs
and cloves were long the objects of the most important branch of
Dutch commerce; and gutta-percha, camphor, dammar, benzoin
and other forest products have a place among the exports.</p>

<p>To the naturalist the Malay Archipelago is a region of the highest
interest; and from an early period it has attracted the attention of
explorers of the first rank. The physical division between the
Asiatic and Australian regions is clearly reflected in the botany
and zoology. The flora of the Asiatic islands (thus distinguished)
&ldquo;is a special development of that prevailing from the Himalayas
to the Malay Peninsula and south China. Farther east this
flora intermingles with that of Australia&rdquo; (F. H. H. Guillemard,
<i>Australasia</i>). Similarly, in the Asiatic islands are found the
great mammals of the continent&mdash;the elephant, tiger, rhinoceros,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page467" id="page467"></a>467</span>
anthropoid ape, &amp;c., which are wanting in the Australian region,
with which the eastern part of the archipelago is associated. (For
details concerning flora and fauna, see separate articles, especially
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Java</a></span>.)</p>

<p class="noind f80"><a href="images/img466b.jpg">(Click to enlarge.)</a></p>

<p class="pt2"><i>Inhabitants.</i>&mdash;The majority of the native inhabitants of the
Malay Archipelago belong to two races, the Malays and the
Melanesians (Papuans). As regards the present racial distribution,
the view accepted by many anthropologists, following A. H.
Keane, is that the Negritos, still found in the Philippines, are
the true aborigines of Indo-China and western Malaysia, while
the Melanesians, probably their kinsmen, were the earliest
occupants of eastern Malaysia and western Polynesia. At some
date long anterior to history it is supposed that Indo-China was
occupied first by a fair Caucasian people and later by a yellow
Mongolian race. From these two have come all the peoples&mdash;other
than Negrito or Papuan&mdash;found to-day from the Malay
Peninsula to the farthest islands of Polynesia. The Malay
Archipelago was thus first invaded by the Caucasians, who
eventually passed eastward and are to-day represented in the
Malay Archipelago only by the Mentawi islanders. They were
followed by an immigration of Mongol-Caucasic peoples with a
preponderance of Caucasic blood&mdash;the Indonesians of some, the
pre-Malays of other writers&mdash;who are to-day represented in the
archipelago by such peoples as the Dyaks of Borneo and the Battas
of Sumatra. At a far later date, probably almost within historic
times, the true Malay race, a combination of Mongol and Caucasic
elements, came into existence and overran the archipelago, in
time becoming the dominant race. A Hindu strain is evident in
Java and others of the western islands; Moors and Arabs (that
is, as the names are used in the archipelago, Mahommedans from
various countries between Arabia and India) are found more or
less amalgamated with many of the Malay peoples; and the
Chinese form, from an economical point of view, one of the most
important sections of the community in many of the more
civilized districts. Chinese have been established in the archipelago
from a very early date: the first Dutch invaders found
them settled at Jacatra; and many of them, as, for instance, the
colony of Ternate, have taken so kindly to their new home that
they have acquired Malay to the disuse of their native tongue.
Chinese tombs are among the objects that strike the traveller&rsquo;s
attention at Amboyna and other ancient settlements.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>There is a vast field for philological explorations in the archipelago.
Of the great number of distinct languages known to
exist, few have been studied scientifically. The most widely
distributed is the Malay, which has not only been diffused by the
Malays themselves throughout the coast regions of the various
islands, but, owing partly to the readiness with which it can be
learned, has become the common medium between the Europeans
and the natives. The most cultivated of the native tongues is the
Javanese, and it is spoken by a greater number of people than
any of the others. To it Sundanese stands in the relation that
Low German holds to High German, and the Madurese in the
relation of a strongly individualized dialect. Among the other
languages which have been reduced to writing and grammatically
analysed are the Balinese, closely connected with the Javanese,
the Batta (with its dialect the Toba), the Dyak and the Macassarese.
Alfurese, a vague term meaning in the mouths of the natives little
else than non-Mahommedan, has been more particularly applied
by Dutch philologists to the native speech of certain tribes in Celebes.
The commercial activity of the Buginese causes their language to
be fairly widely spoken&mdash;little, however, by Europeans.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Political Division.</i>&mdash;Politically the whole of the archipelago,
except British North Borneo, &amp;c. (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Borneo</a></span>), part of Timor
(Portuguese), New Guinea east of the 141st meridian (British
and German), and the Philippine Islands, belongs to the Netherlands.
The Philippine Islands which had been for several
centuries a Spanish possession, passed in 1898 by conquest to the
United States of America. For these several political units
see the separate articles; a general view, however, is here
given of the government, economic conditions, &amp;c., of the Dutch
possessions, which the Dutch call <i>Nederlandsch-Indië</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="pt1 center"><span class="sc">Netherlands India</span></p>

<p><i>Administration.</i>&mdash;The Dutch possessions in Asia lie between
6° N. and 11° S. and 95° E. and 141° E. Politically they are
divided into lands under the direct government of the Netherlands
vassal lands and confederated lands. Administratively they are
further divided into residencies, divisions, regencies, districts, and
<i>dessas</i> or villages. In the principal towns and villages there are
parish councils, and in some provinces county councils have been
established. Natives, Chinese and Arabs, are given seats, and in
certain instances some of the members are elected, but more generally
they are appointed by government. The islands are often
described as of two groups, Java and Madura forming one, and the
other consisting of Sumatra, Borneo, Riouw-Lingga Archipelago,
Banka, Billiton, Celebes, Molucca Archipelago, the small Sunda
Islands, and a part of New Guinea&mdash;the Outposts as they are collectively
named. The Outposts are divided into 20 provinces. A
governor-general holds the superior administrative and executive
authority, and is assisted by a council of five members, partly of a
legislative and partly of an advisory character, but with no share
in the executive work of the government. In 1907 a Bill was
introduced to add four extraordinary members to the council, but
no immediate action was taken. The governor-general not only
has supreme executive authority, but can of his own accord pass
laws and regulations, except in so far as these, from their nature,
belong of right to the home government, and as he is bound by the
constitutional principles on which, according to the <i>Regulations for
the Government of Netherlands India</i>, passed by the king and States-General
in 1854, the Dutch East Indies must be governed. There
are nine departments, each under a director: namely, justice;
interior; instruction, public worship and industry; agriculture
(created in 1905); civil public works; government works (created
in 1908); finance; war; marine. The administration of the larger
territorial divisions (<i>gouvernement</i>, <i>residentie</i>) is in the hands of
Dutch governors, residents, assistant residents and <i>contrôleurs</i>.
In local government a wide use is made of natives, in the appointment
of whom a primary consideration is that if possible the people
should be under their own chieftains. In Surakarta and Jokjakarta
in Java, and in many parts of the Outposts, native princes preserve
their positions as vassals; they have limited power, and act generally
under the supervision of a Dutch official. In concluding treaties
with the vassal princes since 1905, the Dutch have kept in view
the necessity of compelling them properly to administer the revenues
of their states, which some of them formerly squandered in their
personal uses. Provincial banks have been established which
defray the cost of public works.</p>

<p>In no case are the above figures for population more than fairly
accurate, and in some instances they are purely conjectural. The
population is legally divided into Europeans and persons assimilated
to them, and natives and persons assimilated to them. The first
class includes half-castes (who are numerous, for the Dutch are in
closer relationship with the natives than is the case with most
colonizing peoples), and also Armenians, Japanese, &amp;c. The total
number of this class in 1900 was 75,833; 72,019 of these were called
Dutch, but 61,022 of them were born in Netherlands India; there
were also 1382 Germans, 441 British and 350 Belgians. Among
the natives and persons assimilated to them were about 537,000
Chinese and 27,000 Arabs. In the decade 1890-1900 the increase
of the European population was 30.9%, of the Arabs 26.6%, and of
the Chinese 16.5%. A large proportion of the Europeans are
government officials, or retired officials, for many of the Dutch,
once established in the colonies, settle there for life. The remaining
Europeans are mostly planters and heads of industrial establishments;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page468" id="page468"></a>468</span>
the Arabs are nearly all traders, as are some of the Chinese,
but a large number of the latter are labourers in the Sumatra
tobacco plantations and the tin mines of Banka, Billiton, &amp;c. The
bulk of the natives are agriculturists.</p>

<p><i>Religion and Instruction.</i>&mdash;Entire liberty is granted to the members
of all religious confessions. The Reformed Church has about 40
ministers and 30 assistants, the Roman Catholic 35 curates and
20 priests, not salaried out of the public funds. There are about
170 Christian missionaries, and the progress of their work may be
illustrated by showing that the number of Christians among the
natives and foreign Orientals was:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">About 10,000 natives go annually to Mecca on pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Both the government and private enterprise maintain vernacular
schools. Large sums have been voted in Holland for the establishment
of primary and secondary schools, and the government has
undertaken to assist in the establishment of parochial schools, the
object being that every village, at least in Java, should possess one.
There are schools for higher education at Batavia, Surabaya and
Semarang; at the first two of these towns are government schools
for mechanical engineering, and at Batavia a crafts school and a
medical school for natives. There are five colleges for native
schoolmasters and four for sons of native officials. Government
schools for the European education of Chinese children are established
in the principal towns. Private mechanical and crafts
schools are established at Jokjakarta, Surabaya and Semarang, and
there is an agricultural school at Buitenzorg.</p>

<p><i>Justice.</i>&mdash;As regards the administration of justice, the distinction
is maintained between (1) Europeans and persons assimilated with
them (who include Christians and Japanese), and (2) natives,
together with Chinese, Arabs, &amp;c. The former are subject to laws
closely resembling those of the mother country, while the customs
and institutions of natives are respected in connexion with the
administration of justice to the latter. In 1906 a bill was passed
somewhat modifying the existing status of the classes above mentioned,
and especially directing new ordinances with regard to the
judicial treatment of Christian natives. A general judicial revision
being also in contemplation, this bill did not immediately come into
force. Justice for Europeans is administered by European judges,
but, as with administration at large so in judicial matters, native
chiefs have extensive powers in native affairs. For European
justice the High Court of Justice is established at Batavia; there
are councils of justice at Batavia, Semarang and Surabaya, with
authority not only over Java but over parts of the Outposts; there
is a resident court of justice in each residency. For native justice
there are courts in the districts and regencies; residents act as
police judges; provincial councils have judicial powers, and there
are councils of priests with powers in matrimonial disputes, questions
of succession, &amp;c.</p>

<p>As regards pauperism, the government subsidizes Protestant and
Catholic orphan houses.</p>

<p><i>Finance.</i>&mdash;The revenue of Netherlands India has been derived
mainly from customs, excise, ground-tax, licences, poll-tax, &amp;c.,
from monopolies&mdash;opium, salt and pawn-shops (the management of
which began to be taken over by the government in 1903, in place
of the previous system of farming-out), coffee, &amp;c., railways, tin
mines and forests, and from agricultural and other concessions.
But attempts have been made, and have been largely successful,
to make the revenue dependent to a less extent on monopolies and
the products (especially agricultural) of the land; and to abolish
licences and substitute direct taxes. There is a progressive income-tax
for Europeans, and the system has also been applied in the case
of natives.</p>

expenditure:&mdash;</p>

<p>The monetary system is similar to that of Holland (the unit
being the <i>guilder</i>), but there are also certain silver and copper coins
of small value bearing Malay or Javanese inscriptions. The Java
Bank, established in 1828, with headquarters at Batavia, is the only
bank issuing notes, two-fifths of the amount of which must be
covered by specie or bullion. The government has a control over
the administration of this bank.</p>

<p><i>Defence.</i>&mdash;The army is purely colonial, <i>i.e.</i> distinct from that
of the Netherlands. Its strength is a little under 40,000, about
one-third being Europeans of various nationalities and two-thirds
natives of various races. No portion of the regular army of the
Netherlands is allowed to be sent on colonial service, but individual
soldiers are at liberty to enlist, by permission of their commanding
officers, in the army of Netherlands India, and they form its nucleus.
Native and European soldiers are generally mixed together in the
same battalions, though in separate companies. The officers were
all Dutch till 1908, when a trial was made of native officers from
noble Javanese families. The artillery is composed of European
gunners, with native riders, while the cavalry are Europeans and
natives. A military academy is established at Meester Cornelis,
near Batavia. Schools for soldiers are attached to every battalion.
There are certain local forces outside the regular army&mdash;militia in
some of the large towns, native infantry in Madura, and guards of
some of the vassal princes. Unlike the army, which is purely
colonial, the navy in Netherlands India is partly colonial, partly
belonging to the royal navy of the Netherlands, and its expenses
are therefore borne partly by the mother country and partly by the
colony. About six ironclads and twenty smaller vessels of the royal
navy are stationed in colonial waters; the vessels of the colonial
marine number about twenty-four, and undertake police supervision,
prevention of slave trading, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Trade and Industries.</i>&mdash;The principal articles of export are sugar,
tobacco, copra, forest products (various gums, &amp;c.), coffee, petroleum,
tea, cinchona, tin, rice, pepper, spices and gambier. The average
annual value of exports during 1900-1905 was £22,496,468, and of
imports £17,050,338. A great proportion of the exports goes to
the mother country, though a considerable quantity of rice is
exported to China. An indication of the mineral products has
already been given; as regards the export trade, tin is the most
important of these, but the Ombilin coalfields of Sumatra, connected
by a railway with the coast, call for mention here also. Agricultural
labour is very carefully regulated by law, in the enforcement of
which the residents and lower officials have wide powers. One
day&rsquo;s gratuitous labour out of seven or more can be demanded of
labourers either on private or on government estates; but in 1882
this form of labour was for the most part abolished as far as government
estates were concerned, each labourer so exempted paying
one guilder per year. The principal private agricultural estates
are in the west of Java, in which island the greater part of the soil
is government property. Such estates have increased greatly in
number and extent, not only in Java but elsewhere, since the
agrarian law of 1870, under which it became possible for settlers to
obtain waste lands on hereditary lease for 75 years. In 1899 the
total acreage of land ceded was 1,002,766 acres; in 1903 it was
1,077,295. The government ceased to cultivate sugar in 1891, but
coffee, and to some extent cinchona, are cultivated on government
plantations, though not in equal quantity to that grown on land
held on emphyteusis. The average annual yield of sugar in 1900-1905
was 852,400 tons, but it increased steadily during that period.
The average annual yield of coffee during the same period was
101,971,132 &#8468;; it fluctuates greatly. The average annual production
of tobacco is about fifty million pounds from each of the
islands of Java and Sumatra. The total annual yield of the tin mines
is about 15,000 tons, and of the coal mines 240,000 tons. The average
output of petroleum annually in 1900-1905 was 120,000,000
gallons; this, again, has fluctuated greatly. There are upwards of
3000 miles of railways and steam tramways in Netherlands India,
but these are almost entirely in Java; elsewhere only Sumatra has
a few short lines. The principal steamship company in the archipelago
is the Royal Packet (<i>Koninklyke Paketvaart</i>) Company.</p>

<p><i>Portuguese and Spanish Ascendancy, 1511-1595.</i>&mdash;Ptolemy and
other ancient geographers describe the Malay Archipelago, or
part of it, in vague and inaccurate terms, and the traditions they
preserved were supplemented in the middle ages by the narratives
of a few famous travellers, such as Ibn Batuta, Marco Polo,
Odoric of Pordenone and Niccolò Conti. Malay and Chinese
records also furnish material for the early history of individual
islands, but the known history of the archipelago as a whole
begins in the 16th century. At this period a civilization, largely
of Hindu origin, had flourished and decayed in Java, where, as in
all the more important islands, Mahommedanism had afterwards
become the dominant creed. But the smaller islands and the
remoter districts, even of Java and Sumatra, remained in a
condition of complete savagery.</p>

<p>The Portuguese were the first Europeans to colonize any part
of the archipelago. A Portuguese squadron under Diogo Lopes
de Sequeira arrived off Sumatra in 1509, explored the north coast
for some distance, and noted that the inhabitants of the interior
were cannibals, while those of the littoral were civilized and
possessed a gold coinage. The main object of the Portuguese
was to obtain a share in the lucrative spice trade carried on by
the Malays, Chinese and Japanese; the trade-routes of the archipelago
converged upon Malacca, which was the point of departure
for spice merchants trading with every country on the shores
of the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea. In 1511 the Portuguese
under Alphonso d&rsquo;Albuquerque occupied Malacca, and in
November of that year an expedition under Antonio de Abreu
was despatched to find a route to the Moluccas and Banda
Islands, then famous for their cloves and nutmegs. The explorers
reached Amboyna and Ternate, after gaining some knowledge
of Java, Madura, Sumbawa and other islands, possibly
including New Guinea. During the return voyage the second-in-command,
Francisco Serrão, was shipwrecked, but succeeded in
making his way in a native boat to Mindanao. Thus the Philippines
were discovered: In 1514 a second Portuguese fleet arrived
at Ternate, which during the next five years became the centre
of Portuguese enterprise in the archipelago; regular traffic with
Malacca and Cochin was established, and the native raja became
a vassal of Portugal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Spanish government was considering whether
the Moluccas did not fall within the Spanish sphere of influence
as defined by the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494; and in August
1519 an expedition commanded by Ferdinand Magellan (<i>q.v.</i>)
sailed from Seville to seek a westward passage to the archipelago.
After losing the commander in the Philippines and discovering
Borneo, the two surviving ships reached the Moluccas late in
1520. One vessel returned to Seville by the Cape route, thus
completing the first voyage round the world; the other
attempted to return by the Pacific, but was driven back to
Tidore and there welcomed by the natives as a useful ally
against the Portuguese. Reinforcements from Spain arrived
in 1525 and 1528; but in 1529 a treaty was concluded between
the emperor Charles V. and John III. of Portugal, by which,
in return for 350,000 gold ducats, the Spanish claim to the
Moluccas was withdrawn. The boundary between the Spanish
and Portuguese spheres was fixed at 17° E. of the Moluccas,
but by a geographical fiction the Philippines were included
within the Spanish sphere. Further disputes occurred from
time to time, and in 1542 a Spanish fleet came into conflict
with the Portuguese off Amboyna; but after 1529 the supremacy
of each power in its own sphere was never seriously endangered.</p>

<p>Though the Portuguese traders frequented the coast of Java,
they annexed no territory either there or in Sumatra; but farther
east they founded numerous forts and factories, notably in
Amboyna, the Banda Island, Celebes and Halmahera. Ternate
remained the seat of the governor of the Moluccas, who was the
highest official in the archipelago, though subordinate to the viceroy
or governor of Portuguese India. The first attempt to enter
into relations with the states of Borneo was made by D. Jorge
de Menezes, who visited Brunci in 1526, and in 1528 sent an
envoy to its raja. The embassy failed in a curious manner.
Among the gifts sent by Menezes was a piece of tapestry representing
the marriage of Catherine of Aragon to Arthur, prince of
Wales. The raja was persuaded that these mysterious figures
were demons under a spell, which might come to life and kill him
as he slept. The envoy was therefore dismissed.</p>

<p>In 1536, after a period of war and anarchy caused by the
tyrannical rule of Menezes, Antonio Galvão, the historian, was
appointed governor of the Moluccas. He crushed the rebellion
and won the affection of the natives by his just and enlightened
administration, which had no parallel in the annals of Portuguese
rule in the archipelago. He returned to Europe in 1540 (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Portugal</a></span>: <i>Literature</i>), after inaugurating an active missionary
movement, which was revived in 1546-1547 by Francis Xavier
(<i>q.v.</i>). At this period the Portuguese power in the East was
already beginning to wane; in the archipelago it was weakened
by administrative corruption and by incessant war with native
states, notably Bintang and Achin; bitter hostility was aroused
by the attempts which the Portuguese made to establish a commercial
monopoly and to force Christianity upon their native
subjects and allies (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Portugal</a></span>: <i>History</i>). From 1580 to 1640
Portugal was itself united to Spain&mdash;a union which differed from
annexation in little but name.</p>

<p><i>The English and Dutch, 1595-1674.</i>&mdash;Pirates from Dieppe
visited the archipelago between 1527 and 1539. It is possible
that they reached Australia<a name="fa2k" id="fa2k" href="#ft2k"><span class="sp">2</span></a>&mdash;more than sixty years before the
first voyage thither of which there is any clear record; but their
cruise had no political significance, and the Spaniards and
Portuguese remained without European competitors until the
appearance of Sir Francis Drake in 1579. An English squadron
under Sir James Lancaster came into conflict with the Portuguese
in 1591, and an expedition under Sir Henry Middleton traded in
the archipelago in 1604. But the English were simple traders or
explorers; far more formidable were the Dutch, who came to the
East partly to avenge the injuries inflicted on their country by
the Spaniards, partly to break the commercial monopoly of the
peninsular states. As middlemen they already possessed a large
interest in the spice trade, for the Portuguese, having no direct
access to the principal European markets, had made a practice
of sending cargo to the Netherlands for distribution by way of
the Scheldt and Rhine. The Dutch now sought to monopolize
not only the distribution but the production of spices&mdash;an enterprise
facilitated by the co-operation of many exiled Portuguese
Jews who had settled in Holland.</p>

<p>The first Dutch fleet sailed from Texel, under the command of
Cornelis Houtman, on the 2nd of April 1595 and reached Sumatra
on the 1st of January 1596. It visited Madura, and came into
conflict with the Portuguese at Bantam in Java, returning to
Holland in 1597. Though not a commercial success, the expedition
had demonstrated the weakness of the Portuguese. In
1602 the Dutch East India Company (<i>q.v.</i>) was incorporated, and
for nearly two centuries this organization played the chief part in
the history of the archipelago. By 1604 the Dutch could already
claim to be the stronger power at sea. They had attacked the
Portuguese in Ceylon (1601), established friendly relations with
Achin (1602), and defeated a powerful fleet off Banda (1602). In
1606 they concluded a treaty of alliance with the sultan of Johor,
and in 1608 they forced the Portuguese to assent to an armistice
for twelve years. On the 29th of November 1609 Pieter Both
was chosen by the states-general, on the nomination of the Dutch
East India Company, as first governor-general of Netherlands
India. In 1611 the headquarters of the Dutch was changed from
Bantam to <span class="correction" title="amended from Jakatra">Jakarta</span>, which in 1619 was renamed Batavia, and
was thenceforward the Dutch capital. Meanwhile the English
East India Company, chartered in 1600, had also extended its
operations to the archipelago. After 1611 the commercial rivalry
between the Dutch and British became acute, and in 1613, 1615
and 1618 commissioners met in London to discuss the matters
in dispute. The result of their deliberations was the Treaty of
Defence, signed on the 2nd of June 1619 and modified on the 24th
of January 1620, which arranged for co-operation between the
Dutch and British companies, and especially for the maintenance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page470" id="page470"></a>470</span>
of a joint fleet. But neither company could restrain its agents
in the East from aggressive action, and many fresh causes of
dispute arose, the chief being the failure of the British to provide
the naval forces required for service against the Portuguese,
and the so-called &ldquo;massacre of Amboyna&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>) in 1623. The
Treaty of Defence lapsed in 1637, but as early as 1634 the British
made peace with Portugal. Even without allies, however, the
Dutch continued to extend their trade and to annex fresh
territory, for the British were weakened by civil war at home,
while, after 1640, the Portuguese were struggling to maintain
their independence against Spain. The Dutch company opened
up a profitable trade with Japan and China, and prosecuted the
war against Portugal with great vigour, invading Portuguese
India and capturing Point de Galle in 1640, Malacca in 1641,
Cochin and Cannanore in 1663. The war with England in
1652-54 and the renewal of the Anglo-Portuguese alliance by the
marriage of Charles II. to Catherine of Braganza in 1661 were
unable to check the growth of Dutch power; more serious was
the resistance offered by some of the native states. Rebellions in
Java (1629) and the Moluccas (1650) were suppressed with great
severity, but in 1662 the company suffered a heavy reverse in
Formosa, all its colonists being expelled from the island. A new
war between Great Britain and Holland broke out in 1672 and
was terminated by the Treaty of Westminster (February 17,
1674), by which the points at issue between the two companies
were referred first to commissioners and finally to an arbitrator.
The full details of the settlement are unknown, but thenceforward
the British company devoted its energies chiefly to the development
of its Indian possessions, while the Dutch were left supreme
in the archipelago. In 1684 the British even evacuated Bantam,
their chief settlement, and retired to Benkulen in Sumatra, which
remained for more than a century their sole territorial possession
in the archipelago.</p>

<p><i>Dutch Ascendancy, 1674-1749.</i>&mdash;The weakness of Spain and
Portugal and the withdrawal of the British left the Dutch company
free to develop its vast colonial and commercial interests.
In 1627 the so-called Dutch &ldquo;colonial system&rdquo; had been inaugurated
by the fourth governor-general, Jan Pieterszoon
Coen (<i>q.v.</i>). Under this system, which was intended to provide
Netherlands India with a fixed population of European descent,
Dutch girls were sent to the archipelago to be married to
white settlers, and subsequently marriages between Dutchmen
and captive native women were encouraged. As early as 1624
vast fortunes had been acquired by trade: two members of the
company who died in that year were stated to possess seven
and eight tons of gold respectively, an amount approximately
equivalent, in the aggregate, to £2,000,000. The use of slave
labour, and the application of the <i>corvée</i> system to natives who
were nominally free, enabled the company to lower the cost of
production, while the absence of competition enabled it to raise
prices. The hardship inflicted on the native races provoked
an insurrection throughout Java, in which the Chinese settlers
participated; but the Dutch maintained naval and military
forces strong enough to crush all resistance, and a treaty between
the company and the Susuhunan in November 1749 made them
practically supreme throughout the island.</p>

<p><i>Decline of Dutch Power, 1749-1811.</i>&mdash;In the second half of the
17th century the monopoly system and the employment of slaves
and forced labour gave rise to many abuses, and there was a rapid
decline in the revenue from sugar, coffee and opium, while the
competition of the British East India Company, which now
exported spices, indigo, &amp;c. from India to Europe, was severely
felt. The administration was corrupt, largely because of the vast
powers given to officials, who were invariably underpaid; and the
financial methods of the company precipitated its ruin, large
dividends being paid out of borrowed money. The burden of
defence could no longer be sustained; piracy and smuggling
became so common that the company was compelled to appeal
to the states-general for aid. In 1798 it was abolished and its
authority vested in a &ldquo;Council of the Asiatic Possessions.&rdquo; In
1803 a commission met to consider the state of the Dutch colonies,
and advocated drastic administrative and commercial reforms,
notably freedom of trade in all commodities except firearms,
opium, rice and wood&mdash;with coffee, pepper and spices, which
were state monopolies. Some of these reforms were carried out
by H. W. Daendels (1808-1811), who was sent out as governor-general
by Louis Bonaparte, after the French conquest of Holland.
Daendels, however, maintained the existing restrictions
upon trade and even made rice a state monopoly. His harsh
rule aroused great antagonism; in 1811 he was recalled and
J. W. Janssens became governor-general.</p>

<p><i>British Occupation, 1811-1816.</i>&mdash;Netherlands India was at
this time regarded as a part of the Napoleonic Empire, with
which Great Britain was at war. A British naval squadron
arrived in the Moluccas in February 1810 and captured Amboyna,
Banda, Ternate and other islands. In 1811 a strong fleet was
equipped by Lord Minto, then governor-general of India, for
the conquest of Java; a British force was landed on the 4th
of August; Batavia was captured on the 26th, and on the
18th of September Janssens and the remnant of his army surrendered.
Lord Minto had issued a proclamation establishing
British rule on the 11th of September, and Thomas (afterwards
Sir Thomas) Stamford Raffles was appointed lieutenant-governor.
Raffles (<i>q.v.</i>) held office until March 1816, and introduced many
important changes in the departments of revenue, commerce and
judicature. He was succeeded by John Fendall, who in 1816
carried out the retrocession of Netherlands India to the Dutch,
in accordance with the Treaty of Vienna (1814).</p>

<p><i>Restoration and Reform of Dutch Power, 1816-1910.</i>&mdash;Various
disputes between Great Britain and the Netherlands, arising
chiefly out of the transfer of power in Java and the British
occupation of Singapore (1819), were settled by treaty between
the two powers in 1824. By this treaty the Dutch were given
almost entire freedom of action in Sumatra, while the Malay
Peninsula was recognized as within the British sphere of influence.
In 1825-30 a serious rebellion in Java involved the
despatch of a large military force from the Netherlands, and
was with difficulty suppressed. An outbreak of Mahommedan
fanaticism in Sumatra also gave much trouble.</p>

<p>The reform movement inaugurated by the commission of 1803
was resumed in 1830, when Governor-General Johannes van den
Bosch endeavoured to improve the conditions of land-tenure
and agriculture by introducing the so-called &ldquo;culture system.&rdquo;
The native cultivators were to be exempted from the ground-tax,
but were to cultivate one-fifth of their land as the government
might direct, the government taking the produce. This
culture-system worked fairly during Van den Bosch&rsquo;s tenure of
office, but gave rise to many abuses between 1833 and 1844,
involving, as it did, a combination of the <i>métayer</i> and <i>corvée</i>
systems.</p>

<p>In 1848 the <i>Grondwet</i>, or fundamental law of the Netherlands,
recognized for the first time the responsibility of the Dutch nation
for its colonial dependencies. The <i>Grondwet</i> involved certain
important changes, which were embodied in an act passed in 1854
and commonly known as the <i>Regulations for the Government of
Netherlands India</i>. The <i>Regulations</i> substituted statute law for
administrative and military despotism, and made the governor-general
in council responsible to the minister of the colonies at
the Hague. They reformed the judicature, introduced elementary
education for the natives, and abolished slavery in Java as from
the 1st of January 1860. They also prepared the way for further
legislation tending towards the gradual emancipation of the
natives from the culture system, and from semi-feudal servitude
to their native rulers. That servitude existed in many forms
all over the archipelago, but among the most curious must be
reckoned the <i>pandelingschap</i> or &ldquo;pledgedom,&rdquo; which originated
in Borneo, and according to which a man had the power to
make his debtors his serfs until their debts were paid.</p>

<p>The reform movement was aided by the publication in 1860 of
<i>Max Havelaar</i>, a romance by E. Douwes Dekker (<i>q.v.</i>), which
contained a scathing indictment of the colonial system. Many
important financial and agrarian measures were carried between
1860 and 1890. In 1863 Fransen van de Putte, minister for the
colonies, introduced the first of the annual colonial budgets for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page471" id="page471"></a>471</span>
which the <i>Regulations</i> had provided, thus enabling the states-general
to control the revenue and expenditure of Netherlands
India; in 1865 he reduced and in 1872 abolished the differentiation
of customs dues in favour of goods imported from Holland,
substituting a uniform import duty of 6% and establishing a
number of free ports throughout the archipelago. The import
duty was considered so moderate that an increase required for
revenue purposes was readily conceded in 1886. In 1876 the
practice of paying a yearly surplus (<i>batig slot</i>) from the revenues
of Netherlands India to the treasury at the Hague was discontinued.
The chief reforms in the land system were those introduced
by De Waal, then minister for the colonies, in 1870. The
cultivation of pepper, cochineal, cinnamon and indigo for the
government had already ceased; De Waal restricted the area of
the sugar plantations (carried on by forced native labour) as
from 1878, and provided for their abolition after 1890. He also
enabled natives to secure proprietary rights over the land they
cultivated, and legalized the leasing of Crown forest-lands to
Europeans.</p>

<p>The extension of Dutch political power&mdash;notably in Java,
Sumatra, Celebes, the Moluccas, Borneo, the Sunda Islands and
New Guinea&mdash;proceeded simultaneously with the reform movement,
and from time to time involved war with various native
states. A large expedition was sent to Lombok in 1894, and
almost the whole of that island was incorporated in the Dutch
dominions. The long and costly war with Achin (<i>q.v.</i>) began in
1873 and reached its climax in the military occupation of the
country after 1905, when the native sultan surrendered and was
deported. A guerrilla war was still carried on by his subjects, but
their principal leader, the chief Panglima Polim, was captured in
1907; in 1908-1910 the condition of Achin under the military rule
of General Swart was one of almost unbroken peace, and taxes
were regularly paid.</p>

<p>While the Dutch were thus consolidating their authority, other
countries were acquiring new commercial or colonial interests in
the archipelago. Immigration from China and Japan steadily
increased, especially towards the end of the period 1816-1910.
The enterprise of Sir James Brooke (<i>q.v.</i>) led, after 1838, to the
establishment of British sovereignty in North Borneo; in 1895
New Guinea was divided between Great Britain, Germany and
the Netherlands; and the Spanish-American War of 1898 resulted
in the cession of the Philippines, Sulu Island and the largest of the
Mariana Islands to the United States, and the sale of the Caroline
group to Germany. Australian and Japanese trade in the archipelago
was stimulated by the establishment of the Australian
Commonwealth (1901) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904-5).
In 1910 the nations most directly interested in the future of the
archipelago were the Netherlands, Great Britain, the United
States, Germany, Japan, China and Portugal.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAL&#256;IR,<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> a small province of Persia, situated between
Hamadan and Burujird. It has a population of about 70,000,
and, together with the district Tusirkhan, pays a yearly revenue
of about £13,000. It produces much corn and fruit; a great
quantity of the latter, dried, is exported. Its capital and seat of
government is Doletabad (Dowletabad), a thriving little city, with
a population of about 5000, situated at an elevation of 5680 ft.,
38 m. from Hamadan and 32 m. from Burujird. It has post and
telegraph offices.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALAY PENINSULA<a name="ar121" id="ar121"></a></span> (called by the Malays <i>Tanah Malayu</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> the Malay Land), a lozenge-shaped strip of land projecting
into the China Sea, and forming the most southerly portion of the
continent of Asia. Geographically, the peninsula begins at the
isthmus of Kra, 10° N., at which point it is only between 60 and
70 m. in width, and the distance from sea to sea is further
diminished by a large irregular salt-water inlet. Politically and
anthropologically, however, this upper portion must be regarded
as a continuation of the kingdom of Siam rather than as a section
of Malaya. From the isthmus of Kra the peninsula extends
south with a general inclination towards the east, the most
southerly point being Tanjong Bulus in 1° 16½&prime; N. A line drawn
diagonally down the centre from the isthmus of Kra to Cape
Romania (Ramunya) gives the extreme length at about 750 miles.
The breadth at the widest point, from Tanjong Pen-unjut in
Trengganu to Tanjong Hantu in the Dindings territory, is about
200 m. The area is estimated at about 70,000 sq. m. The
peninsula is bounded on the N. by Siam, on the S. by the
island and strait of Singapore, on the E. by the China Sea, and
on the W. by the Strait of Malacca.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Physical Characteristics.</i>&mdash;A range of granite mountains forms a
backbone which divides the peninsula into two unequal portions, the
larger of which lies to the east and the smaller to the west of the
chain. Smaller ranges run parallel to the main mountain chain in
many places, and there are numerous isolated spurs which have no
connexion with either. The country is covered with limestone in
many parts, and large isolated bluffs of this formation stand up in
the plains both on the eastern and the western slopes. The descent
from the summits of the range into the plain is somewhat less abrupt
on the western than it is on the eastern side, and between the foot
of the mountains and the Strait of Malacca the largest known alluvial
deposits of tin are situated. On the eastern side of the range, after
a steep descent, the granite formation speedily gives place to slates
of vast depth, intersected here and thereby fissures of quartz containing
gold, and in many places covered by limestone which has been
superimposed upon the slates. The highest known peak in the
main range is that of Gunong Korbu, 7217 ft. above sea-level.
The highest mountain is believed to be Gunong Tahan, which forms
part of an isolated range on the eastern side, between Pahang and
Kelantan, and is estimated at about 8000 ft. The west coast
throughout its whole length is covered to a depth of some miles
with mangrove swamps, with only a few isolated stretches of sandy
beach, the dim foliage of the mangroves and the hideous mud flats
presenting a depressing spectacle. On the east coast the force of
the north-east monsoon, which beats upon the shores of the China
Sea annually from November to February, has kept the land for
the most part free from mangroves, and the sands, broken here
and there by rocky headlands thickly wooded, and fringed by
<i>casuarina</i> trees, stretch for miles without interruption. The islands
on each coast present the features of the shore to which they are
adjacent. On both the east and the west coast the islands are
thickly wooded, but whereas the former are surrounded by beautiful
sands and beaches, the latter are fringed by mangrove-swamps.
The whole peninsula may be described as one vast forest, intersected
in every direction by countless streams and rivers which
together form the most lavish water-system in the world. Only
an insignificant fraction of these forests has ever been visited by
human beings, the Malays and even the aboriginal tribe having
their homes on the banks of the rivers, and never, even when travelling
from one part of the country to another, leaving the banks of
a stream except for a short time when passing from one river-system
to another. The bulk of the jungle, therefore, which lies between
stream and stream, has never been trodden by the foot of man.
The principal rivers on the west coast are the Perak, the Bernam and
the Muar. The first-named is far finer than its fellows, and is
navigable for steamers for about 40 m. from its mouth, and for
native craft for over 250 m. It is exceedingly shallow, however,
and is not of much importance as a waterway. The Bernam runs
through flat swampy country for the greater part of its course, and
steam-launches can penetrate to a distance of over 100 m. from
its mouth, and it is therefore probably the deepest river. The
country which it waters, however, is not of any value, and it is not
much used. The Muar waters a very fertile valley, and is navigable
for native boats for over 150 m. On the east coast the principal
streams are the Petani, Telubin, Kelantan, Besut, Trengganu,
Dungun, Kmamun, Kuantan, Pahang, Rompin, Endau and Sedeli,
all guarded by difficult bars at their mouths, and dangerous during
the continuance of the north-east monsoon. The deepest rivers
are the Kuantan and Rompin; the largest are the Kelantan and
the Pahang, both of which are navigable for native boats for a
distance of over 250 m. The Trengganu river is obstructed by
impassable rapids at a distance of about 30 m. from its mouth.
The rivers on the east coast are practically the only highways, the
Malays always travelling by boat in preference to walking, but
they serve their purpose very indifferently, and their great beauty
is their chief claim to distinction. Magnificent caves are found on
both slopes of the peninsula, those at Batu in Selangor being the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page472" id="page472"></a>472</span>
finest on the west coast, while those of Chadu and Koto Glanggi
in Pahang are the most extensive yet visited by Europeans on the
east coast. They are all of limestone formation. So far as is known,
the Malay Peninsula consists of an axial zone of crystalline rocks,
flanked on each side by an incomplete band of sedimentary deposits.
Granite is the most widely spread of the crystalline rocks; but
dikes of various kinds occur, and gneiss, schist and marble are also
met with. These rocks form the greater part of the central range,
and they are often&mdash;especially the granite&mdash;decomposed and rotten
to a considerable depth. The sedimentary deposits include slate,
limestone and sandstone. Impure coal has also been recorded.
The limestone has yielded <i>Proetus</i>, <i>Chonetes</i> and other fossils, and
is believed to be of Carboniferous age. In the sandstone Myophoria
and other Triassic fossils have been found, and it appears to belong
to the Rhaetic or Upper Trias.<a name="fa1l" id="fa1l" href="#ft1l"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The minerals produced are tin,
gold, iron, galena and others, in insignificant quantities.</p>

<p>The tin occurs in the form of cassiterite, and is found chiefly in
or near the crystalline rocks, especially the granite. As stream tin
it occurs abundantly in some of the alluvial deposits derived from
the crystalline area, especially on the west coast. Only two tin
lodes are worked, however, and both are situated on the east coast,
the one at Kuantan in Pahang, the other at Bandi in Trengganu
territory. On the west coast no true lode has yet been discovered,
though the vast alluvial deposits of tin found there seem to make
such a discovery probable in the future. Since 1890 the tin
produced from these alluvial beds has supplied between 50% and
75% of the tin of the world. Gold is worked with success in
Pahang, and has been exploited from time immemorial by the
natives of that state and of Kelantan. Small quantities have also
been found on the western slope in Perak.</p>

<p><i>Climate, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;It was formerly the custom to speak of the Malay
Peninsula as an unhealthy climate, and even to compare it with the
west coast of Africa. It is now generally admitted, however, that,
though hot, it compares favourably with that of Burma. The chief
complaint which Europeans make concerning it is the extreme
humidity, which causes the heat to be more oppressive than is the
case where the air is dry. On the other hand, the thermometer,
even at Singapore on the southern coast, which is the hottest portion
of the peninsula, seldom rises above 98° in the shade, whereas the
mean for the year at that place is generally below 80°. On the mainland,
and more especially on the eastern slope, the temperature
is cooler, the thermometer seldom rising above 93° in the shade,
and falling at night below 70°. On an average day in this part of the
peninsula the temperature in a European house ranged from 88° to
68°. The number of rainy days throughout the peninsula varies
from 160 to over 200 in each year, but violent gusts of wind, called
&ldquo;Sumatras,&rdquo; accompanied by a heavy downpour of short duration,
are more common than persistent rain. The rainfall on the west
coast varies from 75 to 120 in. per annum, and that of the east coast,
where the north-east monsoon breaks with all its fury, is usually
about 155 in. per annum. Malarial fevers make their appearance
in places where the forest has been recently felled, or where the surface
earth has been disturbed. It is noticed that labourers employed
in deep mines worked by shafts suffer less from fever than do those
who are engaged in stripping the alluvial deposits. This, of course,
means that a new station, where clearing, digging, and building are
in progress, is often unhealthy for a time, and to this must be
attributed the evil reputation which the peninsula formerly enjoyed.
To Europeans the climate is found to be relaxing and enervating,
but if, in spite of some disinclination for exertion, regular exercise
is taken from the beginning, and ordinary precautions against chills,
more especially to the stomach, are adopted, a European has almost
as good a chance of remaining in good health in the peninsula as in
Europe. A change of climate, however, is imperatively necessary
every five or six years, and the children of European parents should
not be kept in the peninsula after they have attained the age of
four or five years. The Chinese immigrants suffer chiefly from fever
of a malarial type, from beri-beri, a species of tropical dropsy, and
from dysentery. The Malays formerly suffered severely from smallpox
epidemics, but in the portion of the peninsula under British
rule vaccination has been introduced, and the ravages of the disease
no longer assume serious dimensions. Occasional outbreaks of
cholera occur from time to time, and in the independent states
these cause terrible loss of life, as the natives fly from the disease
and spread the infection in every direction. As a whole, the Malays
are, however, a remarkably healthy people, and deformity and hereditary
diseases are rare among them. There is little leprosy in the
peninsula, but there is a leper hospital near Penang on Pula Deraja
and another on an island on the west coast for the reception of lepers
from the Federated Malay States.</p>

<p><i>Flora and Fauna.</i>&mdash;The soil of the peninsula is remarkably fertile
both in the plains and on the mountain slopes. In the vast forests
the decay of vegetable matter during countless ages has enriched
the soil to the depth of many feet, and from it springs the most
marvellous tangle of huge trees, shrubs, bushes, underwood, creepers,
climbing plants and trailing vines, the whole hung with ferns, mosses,
and parasitic growths, and bound together by rattans and huge
rope-like trailers. In most places the jungle is so dense that it is
impossible to force a way through it without the aid of a wood-knife,
and even the wild beasts use well-worn game-tracks through the
forest. In the interior brakes of bamboos are found, many of which
spread for miles along the river banks. Good hard-wood timber
is found in plenty, the best being the <i>merabau</i>, <i>penak</i>, <i>rasok</i> and
<i>chengal</i>. Orchids of countless varieties abound. The principal
fruit trees are the <i>duri-an</i>, mangosteen, custard-apple, pomegranate,
<i>rambut-an</i>, <i>pulas-an</i>, <i>langsat</i>, <i>rambai</i>, jack-fruit, coco-nut, areca-nut,
sugar-palm, and banana. Coffee, tobacco, sugar-cane, rice, pepper,
gambier, cotton and sago are cultivated with success. Great
developments have been made of recent years in the cultivation of
rubber in British Malaya. The principal jungle products are gutta
and rubber of several varieties, and many kinds of rattan. The mangrove
grows on the shores of the west coast in profusion. Agilawood,
the camphor tree, and ebony are also found in smaller
quantities.</p>

<p>The fauna of the peninsula is varied and no less profuse than is
the vegetable life. The Asiatic elephant; the <i>seladang</i>, a bison of
a larger type than the Indian gaur; two varieties of rhinoceros; the
honey bear (<i>bruang</i>), the tapir, the sambhur (<i>rusa</i>); the speckled
deer (<i>kijang</i>), three varieties of mouse-deer (<i>napoh</i>, <i>plandok</i> and
<i>kanchil</i>); the gibbon (<i>ungka</i> or <i>wawa&rsquo;</i>), the <i>siamang</i>, another species
of anthropoid ape, the <i>brok</i> or coco-nut monkey, so called because
it is trained by the Malays to gather the nuts from the coco-nut
trees, the <i>lotong</i>, <i>kra</i>, and at least twenty other kinds of monkey;
the <i>binturong</i> (<i>arctictis binturong</i>), the lemur; the Asiatic tiger, the
black panther, the leopard, the large wild cat (<i>harimau akar</i>), several
varieties of jungle cat; the wild boar, the wild dog; the flying squirrel,
the flying fox; the python, the cobra, and many other varieties of
snake, including the hamadryad; the alligator, the otter and the
gavial, as well as countless kinds of squirrel, rat, &amp;c., are found
throughout the jungles of the peninsula in great numbers. On the
east coast peafowl are found, and throughout the interior the argus
pheasant, the firebacked pheasant, the blue partridge, the adjutant-bird,
several kinds of heron and crane, duck, teal, cotton-teal,
snipe, wood-pigeon, green-pigeon of several varieties, swifts, swallows,
pied-robins, hornbills, parakeets, fly-catchers, nightjars, and many
other kinds of bird are met with frequently. A few specimens of
solitary goose have been procured, but the bird is rarely met with.
The forests literally swarm with insects of all kinds, from <i>cicadae</i>
to beautiful butterflies, and from stick- and leaf-insects to endless
varieties of ants. The scorpion and the centipede are both common.
The study of the insect life of the peninsula opens a splendid field
for scientific research, and the profusion and variety of insects found
in these forests probably surpass those to be met with anywhere else
in the world.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Political Divisions and Population.</i>&mdash;Politically the Malay
Peninsula is divided into four sections: the colony of the Straits
Settlements and the Federated Malay States; the independent
Malay State of Johor, which is within the British sphere of influence;
the non-federated states under British protection; and
the groups of states to the north of Perak and Pahang which are
now recognized as lying within the sphere of influence of Siam.
The colony of the Straits Settlements consists of the islands of
Singapore, Penang and the Dindings, the territory of Province
Wellesley, on the mainland opposite to Penang, the insignificant
territory of the Dindings, and the town and territory of Malacca.
The Federated Malay States under British protection consist of
the sultanates of Perak, Selangor and the Negri Sambilan on the
west coast, and the sultanate of Pahang on the east coast. Johor
is the only Malay state in the southern portion of the peninsula,
the whole of which is within the British sphere, which has been
suffered to remain under native rule. The non-federated states
under British protection (since 1909) are Kelantan, Trengganu,
Kedah and Perlis (Palit). The population of the peninsula numbers
about 2,000,000, of whom about 600,000 inhabit the colony
of the Straits Settlements, about 900,000 the Federated Malay
States, about 200,000 the Malay State of Johor, and about
250,000 to 300,000 the remainder of the peninsula. The population
of the peninsula includes about 850,000 Chinese, mostly
immigrants or descendants of immigrants from the southern
provinces of China, of whom about 300,000 reside in the colony
of the Straits Settlements, 365,000 in the Federated Malay States,
150,000 in Johor, and the remainder in smaller communities or
as isolated traders scattered throughout the villages and small
towns of the peninsula. The Malay population of the peninsula,
including immigrants from the eastern archipelago, number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page473" id="page473"></a>473</span>
some 750,000 to 800,000, while the Tamils and other natives of
India number about 100,000, the aboriginal natives of the peninsula
perhaps 20,000, Europeans and Americans about 6500, and
Eurasians about 9000. The colony of the Straits Settlements,
and to a lesser extent the towns of the Federated Malay States,
carry a considerable heterogenous population, in which most of
the races of Asia find their representatives.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="pt2"><i>Races of the Peninsula.</i>&mdash;Excluding the Tai, or Siamese, who are
undoubtedly recent intruders from the north, there are three races
which for an extended period of time have had their home in the
Malay Peninsula. These are the Semang or Pangan, the Sakai or
Jakun, and the Malays. The Semang, as they are most usually
called by the Malays, are Negritos&mdash;a small, very dark people, with
features of the negroid type, very prognathous, and with short,
woolly hair clinging to the scalp in tiny crisp curls. These people
belong to the race which would seem to be the true aboriginal stock
of southern Asia. Representatives of it are found scattered about
the islands from the Andaman group southwards. The state of
civilization to which they have attained is very low. They neither
plant nor have they any manufactures except their rude bamboo
and rattan vessels, the fish and game traps which they set with much
skill, and the bows, blow-pipes and bamboo spears with which they
are armed. They are skilful hunters, however, catch fish by ingeniously
constructed traps, and live almost entirely on jungle-roots
and the produce of their hunting and fishing. The most civilized
of these people is found in Upper Perak, and the members of this clan
have acquired some knowledge of the art of planting, &amp;c. They
cannot, however, be taken as typical of their race, and other specimens
of this people are seldom seen even by the Sakai. From time to time
they have been raided by the latter, and many Negritos are to be
found in captivity in some of the Malayan villages on the eastern
side of the peninsula. The mistake of speaking
of the Sakai tribes as practically identical with
the Semang or Pangan has very frequently been
made, but as a matter of fact the two races are
absolutely distinct from one another. It has
also been customary to include the Sakai in the
category of Malayan races, but this too is undoubtedly
incorrect. The Sakai still inhabit in
greatest numbers the country which forms the
interior of Pahang, the Plus and Kinta districts
of Perak, and the valley of Nenggiri in Kelantan.
Representatives of their race are also found
scattered among the Malayan villages throughout
the country, and also along the coast, but
these have intermixed so much with the Malays,
and have acquired so many customs, &amp;c., from
their more civilized neighbours, that they can no
longer be regarded as typical of the race to which
they belong. The pure Sakai in the interior
have a good knowledge of planting rice, tapioca,
&amp;c., fashion pretty vessels from bamboos, which
they decorate with patterns traced by the aid of
fire, make loin-cloths (their only garment) from
the bark of the <i>trap</i> and <i>ipoh</i> trees; are very
musical, using a rude lute of bamboo, and a nose-flute
of a very sweet tone, and singing in chorus
very melodiously; and altogether have attained
in their primitive state to a higher degree of
civilization than have the Semang. They are
about as tall as the average Malay, are slimly
built, light of colour, and have wavy fine hair. In
their own language they usually have only three
numerals, viz. <i>na-nun</i>, one; <i>nar</i>, two; and <i>ne&rsquo;</i>,
three, or variants of these; all higher arithmetical
ideas being expressed by the word <i>kerpn</i>, which
means &ldquo;many.&rdquo; A few cases have been recorded,
however, of tribes who can count in their
own tongue up to four and five. Among the
more civilized, however, the Malay numerals up
to ten are adopted by the Sakai. An examination
of their language seems to indicate that it
belongs to the Mon-Khmer group of languages,
and the anthropological information forthcoming
concerning the Sakai points to the conclusion
that they show a greater affinity to the people of
the Mon-Khmer races than to the Malayan stock.
Though they now use metal tools imported by
the Malays, it is noticeable that the names
which they give to those weapons which most
closely resemble in character the stone implements
found in such numbers all over the peninsula
are native names wholly unconnected with
their Malay equivalents. On account of this, it
has been suggested that in a forgotten past the
Sakai were themselves the fashioners of the
stone implements, and certain it is that all tools
which have no representatives among the stone
kelts are known to the Sakai by obvious corruptions
of their Malayan names. The presence of
the Sakai, a people of the Mon-Khmer stock, in
the interior of the peninsula has also been considered
as one of many proofs that the Malays
intruded from the south and approached the
peninsula by means of a sea-route, since had
they swept down from the north, being driven
thence by the people of a stronger breed, it
might be expected that the fringe of country dividing the two
contending races would be inhabited by men of the more feeble
stock. Instead, we find the Sakai occupying this position, thus
indicating that they have been driven northward by the Malays, and
that the latter people has not been expelled by the Mon-Khmer
races from the countries now represented by Burma, Siam and French
Indo-China. The Sakai population is dying out, and must eventually
disappear. (With regard to the Malay, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Malays</a></span>.)</p>

<p><i>Archaeology.</i>&mdash;The only ancient remains found in the peninsula
are the stone implements, of which mention has already been made,
and some remarkable ancient mines, which are situated in the Jelai
valley in Pahang. The stone implements are generally of one or
two types: a long rectangular adze or wedge rudely pointed at one
end, and used in conjunction with a mallet or flat stone, and a
roughly triangular axe-head, which has evidently been fixed in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page474" id="page474"></a>474</span>
cleft of a split stick. A few stones, which might perhaps be arrowheads,
have been found, but they are very rare. The mines, which
have been constructed for the purpose of working quartz lodes
containing gold, are very extensive, and argue a high stage of civilization
possessed by the ancient miners. They consist of a number of
circular or rectangular pits sunk from the cap of a hill, and going
down to a depth of in some cases as much as 120 ft., until in fact
the miners have been stopped by being unable to cope with the
quantity of water made when the level of the valley was reached.
The shafts are placed so close together that in many instances they
are divided by only a couple of feet of solid ground, but at their bases
a considerable amount of gallery work has been excavated, though
it is possible that this was done by miners who came after the people
who originally sank the shafts. Native tradition attributes these
mines to the Siamese, but no importance can be attached to this,
as it is very general for the Malays to give this explanation for anything
which is obviously not the work of their own ancestors. A
theory, which seems to have some probability in its favour, is that
these mines were worked by the Khmer people during the period of
power, energy and prosperity which found its most lofty expression
in the now ruined and deserted city of Angkor Thom; while another
attributes these works to the natives of India whose Hindu remains
are found in Java and elsewhere, whose influence was at one time
widespread throughout Malayan lands, and of whose religious
teaching remnants still linger in the superstitions of the Malays and
are preserved in some purity in Lombok and Bali. In the absence,
however, of any relics of a kind which might lead to the identification
of the ancient miners, their nationality and origin are matters which
must continue to be mere questions of speculation and conjecture.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The first hint to reach Europe concerning the existence
of habitable lands to the eastward of the Ganges is to be
found in the writings of Pomponius Mela (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 43) which speak
of Chryse, or the Golden Isle, as lying off Cape Tamus&mdash;supposed
to be the most easterly point in Asia&mdash;and over against the
estuary of the Ganges. Thereafter there occur vague references
to Chryse in the <i>Periplus of the Erythrean Sea</i>, &amp;c., but the earliest
trace of anything resembling first-hand knowledge concerning
the peninsula of Indo-China and Malaya is revealed in the
writings of Ptolemy, whose views were mainly derived from those
of his predecessor Marinus of Tyre, who in his turn drew his
deductions from information supplied to him by the mariner
Alexander who, there is every reason to think, had himself
voyaged to the Malay Peninsula and beyond. In the light of
present knowledge concerning the trade-routes of Asia, which
had been in existence for thousands of years ere ever Europeans
attempted to make use of them, it is safe to identify Ptolemy&rsquo;s
Sinus Perimulicus with the Gulf of Siam, the Sinus Sabaricus
with the Straits of Malacca from their southern portals to the
Gulf of Martaban, the Aurea Chersonesus with the Malay Peninsula,
and the island of Iabadius or Sabadius&mdash;the reading of the
name is doubtful&mdash;with Sumatra, not as has often been mistakenly
attempted with Java. Although the first definite
endeavour to locate the Golden Chersonese thus dates from the
middle of the 2nd century of our era, the name was apparently
well known to the learned of Europe at a somewhat earlier period,
and in his <i>Antiquities of the Jews</i>, written during the latter half
of the 1st century, Josephus says that Solomon gave to the pilots
furnished to him by Hiram of Tyre commands &ldquo;that they should
go along with his stewards to the land that of old was called
Ophir, but now the Aurea Chersonesus, which belongs to India,
to fetch gold.&rdquo; After the time of Ptolemy no advance in knowledge
concerning the geography of south-eastern Asia was made
until Cosmas Indicopleustes, a monk and an Alexandrian Greek,
wrote from personal knowledge between <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 530 and 550. His
primary object was to prove that the world was built after the
same shape and fashion as the Ark made by the Children of Israel
in the desert; but he was able to show that the Malay Peninsula
had to be rounded and thereafter a course steered in a northerly
direction if China was to be reached. Meanwhile inter-Asiatic
intercourse by means of sea-routes had been steadily on the
increase since the discovery of the way to utilize the monsoons
and to sail directly to and fro across the Indian Ocean (attributed
to the Greek pilot Hippalus) had been made. After the decline
of the power of Rome, the dominant force in Asiatic commerce
and navigation was Persia, and from that time onward, until the
arrival of the Portuguese upon the scene early in the 16th century
the spice trade, whose chief emporia were in or near the Malay
Peninsula, was in Persian or Arab hands. There is considerable
reason to think, however, that the more frequent ports of call in
the Straits of Malacca were situated in Sumatra, rather than on
the shores of the Malay Peninsula, and two famous medieval
travellers, Marco Polo and Ibn Batuta, both called and
wintered at the former, and make scant mention of the latter.</p>

<p>The importance of the Malay Peninsula, as has been noted,
consisted in the privilege which its locality conferred upon it of
being the distributing centre of the spices brought thither from
the Moluccas <i>en route</i> for India and Europe. As early as the
3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Megasthenes makes mention of spices brought
to the shores of the Ganges from &ldquo;the southern parts of India,&rdquo;
and the trade in question was probably one of the most ancient
in the world. So long, however, as India held the monopoly
of the clove, the Malay Peninsula was ignored, the Hindus spreading
their influence through the islands of the archipelago and
leaving traces thereof even to this day. The Mahommedan
traders from Persia and Arabia, following the routes which had
been prepared for them by their forebears, broke down the Hindu
monopoly and ousted the earlier exploiters so effectually that
by the beginning of the 16th century the spice trade was almost
exclusively in their hands. These traders were also missionaries
of their religion, as indeed is every Mahommedan, and to them
is due the conversion of the Malays from rude pantheism, somewhat
tinctured by Hindu mythology, to the Mahommedan creed.
The desire to obtain the monopoly of the spice trade has been
a potent force in the fashioning of Asiatic history. The Moluccas
were, from the first, the objective of the Portuguese invaders,
and no sooner had the white men found their way round the Cape
of Good Hope and established themselves successively upon the
coast of East Africa, in the neighbourhood of the Gulf of Aden
and the Malabar coast, than Malacca, then the chief trading
centre of the Malayan Archipelago, became the object of their
desire. The first Portuguese expedition sent out to capture
Malacca was under the command of Diogo Lopez de Siqueira
and sailed from Portugal in 1508. At Cochin Siqueira took on
board certain adherents of Alphonso d&rsquo;Alboquerque who were
in bad odour with his rival d&rsquo;Almeida, among them being
Magellan, the future circumnavigator of the world, and Francisco
Serrão, the first European who ever lived in the Spice Islands.
Siqueira&rsquo;s expedition ended in failure, owing partly to the
aggressive attitude of the Portuguese, partly to the very justifiable
suspicions of the Malays, and he was presently forced to
destroy one of his vessels, to leave a number of his men in captivity,
and to sail direct for Portugal. In 1510 a second expedition
against Malacca was sent out from Portugal under the
command of Diogo Mendez de Vasconcellos, but d&rsquo;Alboquerque
retained it at Cochin to aid him in the retaking of Goa, and it
was not until 1511 that the great viceroy could spare time to
turn his attention to the scene of Siqueira&rsquo;s failure. After some
futile negotiations, which had for their object the recovery of the
Portuguese captives before hostilities should begin, an assault
was delivered upon Malacca, and though the first attempt to
take the city failed after some hard fighting, a second assault
made some days later succeeded, and Malacca passed for ever
into European hands. The Portuguese were satisfied with the
possession of Malacca itself and did not seek further to extend
their empire in Malaya. Instead they used every endeavour
to establish friendly relations with the rulers of all the neighbouring
kingdoms, and before d&rsquo;Alboquerque returned to India he
despatched embassies to China, Siam, and several kingdoms of
Sumatra, and sent a small fleet, with orders to assume a highly
conciliatory attitude toward all natives, in search of the Moluccas.
Very soon the spice trade had become a Portuguese monopoly,
and Malacca was the great headquarters of the trade. It should
moreover be noted that Magellan&rsquo;s famous expedition had for
its object not the barren feat of circumnavigation but the breaking
down of this monopoly, without violating the terms of the
papal bull which gave to Spain the conquest of the West, to
Portugal the possession of the East. In 1528 a French expedition
sailed from Dieppe, penetrated as far as Achin in Sumatra,
but returned without reaching the Malay Peninsula. It was,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page475" id="page475"></a>475</span>
however, the first attempt ever made to defy the papal bull.
In 1591, three years after the defeat of the Armada, Raymond
and Lancaster rounded the Cape, and after cruising off Penang,
decided to winter in Achin. They subsequently hid among the
Pulau Sambilan near the mouth of the Perak river, and thence
captured a large Portuguese vessel which was sailing from
Malacca in company with two Burmese ships. In 1595 the first
Dutch expedition sailed from the Texel, but it took a more
southerly course than its predecessors and confined its operations
to Java and the neighbouring islands. During this period Achin
developed a determined enmity to the Portuguese, and more
than one attempt was made to drive the strangers from Malacca.
Eventually, in 1641, a joint attack was made by the Achinese
and the Dutch, but the latter, not the people of the sturdy little
Sumatran kingdom, became the owners of the coveted port.
Malacca was taken from the Dutch by the British in 1795; was
restored to the latter in 1818; but in 1824 was exchanged for
Benkulen and a few more unimportant places in Sumatra. The
first British factory in the peninsula was established in the native
state of Patani on the east coast in 1613, the place having been
used by the Portuguese in the 16th century for a similar purpose;
but the enterprise came to an untimely end in 1620 when Captain
Jourdain, the first president, was killed in a naval engagement
in Patani Roads by the Dutch. Penang was purchased from
Kedah in 1786, and Singapore from the then sultan of Johor in
1819. The Straits Settlements&mdash;Singapore, Malacca and Penang&mdash;were
ruled from India until 1867, when they were erected into
a crown colony under the charge of the Colonial Office. In 1874
the Malay state of Perak was placed under British protection
by a treaty entered into with its sultan; and this eventually led
to the inclusion in a British protectorate of the neighbouring
Malay States of Selangor, Sungei Ujong, the cluster of small
states called the Negri Sembilan and Pahang, which now form
the Federated Malay States. By a treaty made between Great
Britain and Siam in 1902 the northern Malay states of the peninsula
were admitted to lie within the Siamese sphere of influence,
but by a treaty of 1909 Siam ceded her suzerain rights over the
states of Kelantan, Trengganu, Kedah and Perlis to Britain.</p>

<p>Singapore is the political, commercial and administrative
headquarters of the colony of the Straits Settlements, and the
governor for the time being is <i>ex officio</i> high commissioner of the
Federated Malay States, British North Borneo, Sarawak, the
Cocos-Keeling and Christmas Islands, and governor of Labuan.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALAYS,<a name="ar122" id="ar122"></a></span> the name given by Europeans to the people calling
themselves <i>Orang Malayu</i>, <i>i.e.</i> Malayan folk, who are the dominant
race of the Malay Peninsula and of the Malay Archipelago.
Broadly speaking, all the brown races which inhabit the portion
of Asia south of Siam and Indo-China, and the islands from
the Philippines to Java, and from Sumatra to Timor, may be
described as belonging to the Malayan family, if the aboriginal
tribes, such as the Sakai and Semang in the Malay Peninsula,
the Bataks in Sumatra, and the Muruts in Borneo, be excepted.
For the purposes of this article, however, only those among these
races which bear the name of Orang Malayu, speak the Malayan
language, and represent the dominant people of the land, can
be included under the title of Malays. These people inhabit
the whole of the Malayan Peninsula to the borders of lower
Siam, the islands in the vicinity of the mainland, the shores of
Sumatra and some portions of the interior of that island, Sarawak
and Brunei in Borneo, and some parts of Dutch Borneo,
Batavia and certain districts in Java, and some of the smaller
islands of the archipelago. Though in these lands they have
for not less than a thousand years enjoyed the position of the
dominant race, they all possess a tradition that they are not
indigenous, and that their first rulers &ldquo;came out of the sea,&rdquo; with
a large band of Malayan warriors in their train. In the peninsula
especially, where the presence of the Malays is more recent than
elsewhere, many traditions exist which point to a comparatively
recent occupation of the country. It has been remarked that there
is evidence that the Malays had attained to a certain stage of
civilization before ever they set foot in Malaya. For instance,
the names which they give to certain fruits, such as the <i>duri-an</i>,
the <i>rambut-an</i> and the <i>pulas-an</i>, which are indigenous in the
Malayan countries, and are not found elsewhere, are all compound
words meaning respectively the thorny, the hairy and
the twisted fruit. These words are formed by the addition of the
substantial affix &ldquo;-<i>an</i>,&rdquo; the use of which is one of the recognized
methods by which the Malays turn primitive words into terms
of more complex meaning. This may be taken to indicate
that when first the Malays became acquainted with the fruits
which are indigenous in Malayan lands they already possessed
a language in which most primary words were represented, and
also that their tongue had attained to a stage of development
which provided for the formation of compound words by a
system sanctioned by custom and the same linguistic instinct
which causes a Malay to-day to form similar compounds from
European and other foreign roots. For any aboriginal race
inhabiting these countries, such important articles of diet as the
<i>duri-an</i>, &amp;c., could not fail to be among the first natural objects
to receive a name, and thus we find primary terms in use among
the Sakai and Semang, the aborigines of the Peninsula, to describe
these fruits. The use by the Malays of artificially constructed
terms to denote these things may certainly be taken to
strengthen the opinion that the Malays arrived in the lands they
now inhabit at a comparatively late period in their history, and
at a time when they had developed considerably from the original
state of primitive man.</p>

<p>In the Malay Peninsula itself there is abundant evidence,
ethnological and philological, of at least two distinct immigrations
of people of the Malayan stock, the earlier incursions, it is
probable, taking place from the eastern archipelago to the south,
the later invasion spreading across the Straits of Malacca from
Sumatra at a comparatively recent date. The fact that the
semi-wild tribes, which are ethnologically Malayan and distinct
from the aboriginal Semang and Sakai, are met with almost
invariably in the neighbourhood of the coast would seem to
indicate that they reached the peninsula by a sea, not by a land
route, a supposition which is strengthened by their almost
amphibious habits. Many of these tribes have retained their
pristine paganism, but many others it is certain have adopted
the Mahommedan religion and have been assimilated by the
subsequent and stronger wave of Sumatran immigrants. A
study of the local dialects to be met with in some of the districts
of the far interior, <i>e.g.</i> the Tembeling valley in Pahang, whose
people are now Mahommedans and in many respects indistinguishable
from the ordinary Malays of the peninsula, reveals
the fact that words, current in the archipelago to the south but
incomprehensible to the average peninsula Malays, by whom
these more ancient populations are now completely surrounded,
have been preserved as local words, whereas they really belong
to an older dialect once spoken widely in the peninsula, as to-day
it is spoken in the Malayan islands. This would seem to show
that in some instances the earlier Malay immigrants fell or were
driven by the later invaders back from the coast and sought
refuge in the far interior.</p>

<p>Until recently many eminent scientists held the theory that
the Malayan peoples were merely an offspring of the Mongol stock,
and that their advance into the lands they now inhabit
had taken place from the cradle of the Mongolian
<span class="sidenote">Theories of Origin.</span>
race&mdash;that is to say, from the north. In the
fifth edition of his <i>Malay Archipelago</i>, A. R. Wallace notes the
resemblance which he traced between the Malays and the
Mongolians, and others have recorded similar observations as
to the physical appearance of the two races. To-day, however,
fuller data are available than when Wallace wrote, and the more
generally accepted theory is that the Malayan race is distinct,
and came from the south, until it was stayed by the Mongolian
races living on the mainland of southern Asia. The cranial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page476" id="page476"></a>476</span>
measurements of the Malays and an examination of their hair
sections seem to bear out the theory that they are distinct from
the Mongolian races. Their language, which is neither monosyllabic
nor tonic, has nothing in common with that of the Mon-Annam
group. It has, moreover, been pointed out that had
the Malays been driven southwards by the stronger races of the
mainland of Asia, it might be expected that the people inhabiting
the country nearest to the border between Siam and Malaya
would belong to the Malayan and not to the Mon-Annam or
Mon-Khmer stock. As a matter of fact the Sâkai of the interior
of the peninsula belong to the latter race. It might also be
anticipated, were the theory of a southward immigration to be
sustained, that the Malays would be new-comers in the islands
of the archipelago, and have their oldest settlements on the
Malayan Peninsula. The facts, however, are in exact contradiction
to this; and accordingly the theory now most generally held
by those who have studied the question is that the Malays form
a distinct race, and had their original home in the south. Where
this home lay it is not easy to say, but the facts recorded by
many writers as to the resemblance between the Polynesian and
the Malayan races, and the strong Malayan element found in
the languages of the former (see Tregear&rsquo;s <i>Maori and Comparative
Polynesian Dictionary</i>, London, 1891), have led some students
to think that the two races may have had a common origin.
John Crawfurd, in the Dissertation to his <i>Dictionary of the Malay
Language</i>, published in 1840, noted the prevalence of Malayan
terms in the Polynesian languages, and attributed the fact to
the casting away of ships manned by Malays upon the islands
of the Polynesian Archipelago. The appearance of the same
Malayan words in localities so widely separated from each other,
however, cannot be satisfactorily accounted for by any such
explanation, and the theory is now more generally held that the
two races are probably allied and may at some remote period
of history have shared a common home. It has been suggested
that their separation did not take place until after the continent
which once existed in the north Pacific had become submerged,
and that the Malays wandered northward, while the Polynesian
race spread itself over the islands of the southern archipelago.
All this, however, must necessarily be of the nature of the purest
speculation, and the only facts which we are able to deduce in
the present state of our knowledge of the subject may be summed
up as follows: (<i>a</i>) That the Malays ethnologically belong to a
race which is allied to the Polynesians; (<i>b</i>) that the theory
formerly current to the effect that the Sakai and other similar
races of the peninsula and archipelago belonged to the Malayan
stock cannot be maintained, since recent investigations tend to
identify them with the Mon-Annam or Mon-Khmer family of
races; (<i>c</i>) that the Malays are, comparatively speaking, new-comers
in the lands which they now inhabit; (<i>d</i>) that it is almost
certain that their emigration took place from the south; (<i>e</i>) and
that, at some remote period of their history, they came into close
contact with the Polynesian race, probably before its dispersion
over the extensive area which it now occupies.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Malays to-day are Sunni Mahommedans of the school of
Shafi&rsquo;i, and they habitually use the terms <i>Orang Malayu</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a Malay,
and <i>Orang Islam</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a Mahommedan, as synonymous
expressions. Their conversion from paganism took
<span class="sidenote">Religion and Superstitions.</span>
place during the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries of our era.
The raja of Achin, in northern Sumatra, is said to have
been converted as early as 1206, while the Bugis people in Celebes
are supposed not to have become Mahommedans until 1495.
Mahommedanism undoubtedly spread to the Malays of the peninsula
from Sumatra, but their conversion was slow and gradual, and may
even now in some respects be regarded as imperfect. Upon the bulk
of the Malayan peoples their religion sits but lightly. Few are found
to observe the law concerning the Five Hours of Prayer, and many fail
to put in an appearance at the Friday congregational services in
the mosques. The Fast of Ramadh&#257;n, however, is generally observed
with some faithfulness. Compared with other Mahommedan
peoples, the Malays are not fanatical, though occasionally an outbreak
against those of a different creed is glorified by them into a
holy war. The reason of such outbreaks, however, is usually to be
found in political and social rather than in religious grievances.
Prior to their conversion to Mahommedanism the Malays were
subjected to a considerable Hindu influence, which reached them by
means of the traders who visited the archipelago from India. In
the islands of Bali and Lombok the people still profess a form of
Hinduism, and Hindu remains are to be found in many other parts
of the archipelago, though their traces do not extend to the peninsula.
Throughout, however, the superstitions of the Malays show indications
of this Hindu influence, and many of the demons whom
their medicine-men invoke in their magic practices are clearly
borrowed from the pantheon of India. For the rest, a substratum
of superstitious beliefs, which survives from the days when the Malays
professed only their natural religion, is to be found firmly rooted
in the minds of the people, and the influence of Mahommedanism,
which regards such things with horror, has been powerless to eradicate
this. Mr W. W. Skeat&rsquo;s <i>Malay Magic</i> (London, 1900) is a
compilation of all the writings on the subject of Malay superstitions
by the best authorities and contains considerable original matter.</p>

<p>The Malays of the coast are a maritime people, and were long
famous for the daring character of their acts of piracy. They are
now peaceable fisher-folk, who show considerable
ingenuity in their calling. Inland the Malays live by
<span class="sidenote">Mode of Life, &amp;c.</span>
preference on the banks of rivers, building houses on
piles some feet from the ground, and planting groves of coco-nut,
betel-nut, sugar-palm and fruit-trees around their dwellings. Behind
their villages the rice-fields usually spread, and rice, which is the
staple food of the people, is the principal article of agriculture among
them. Sugar-cane, maize, tapioca and other similar products
are grown, however, in smaller quantities. In planting rice three
methods are in use: the cultivation of swamp-rice in irrigated
fields; the planting of ploughed areas; and the planting of hill-rice
by sowing each grain separately in holes bored for the purpose.
In the irrigated fields the rice plants are first grown in nurseries,
and are subsequently transplanted when they have reached a certain
stage of development. The Malays also work jungle produce,
of which the most important are gutta, rattans, agila wood, camphor
wood, and the beautiful <i>kamuning</i> wood which is used by the natives
for the hilts of their weapons. The principal manufactures of the
Malays are cotton and silk cloths, earthenware and silver vessels,
mats and native weapons. The best cotton cloths are those manufactured
by the Bugis people in Celebes, and the <i>batek</i> cloths which
come from Java and are stamped with patterns. The best silks
are produced by the natives of Pahang, K&#277;lantan and Johor in the
Malay Peninsula. Lord Leighton pronounced the silver ware
from Malaya to be the most artistic of any exhibited at the Colonial
Exhibition held in London in 1886. The pottery of the Malays
is rude but curious. When the first Europeans visited the Malay
Archipelago the Malays had already acquired the art of manufacturing
gunpowder and forging <span class="correction" title="amended from canon">cannon</span>. The art of writing also
appears to have been independently invented by the Malayan races,
since numerous alphabets are in use among the peoples of the
archipelago, although for the writing of Malay itself the Arabic
character has been adopted for some hundreds of years. The Malays
are excellent boat-builders.</p>

<p>While the Malays were famous almost exclusively for their
piratical expeditions they naturally bore an evil reputation among
Europeans, but now that we have come into closer
contact with them, and have learned to understand
<span class="sidenote">Character, &amp;c.</span>
them better, the old opinions concerning them have been
greatly modified. They used to be described as the most cruel
and treacherous people in the world, and they certainly are callous
of the pain suffered by others, and regard any strategy of which
their enemies are the victims with open admiration. In ordinary
circumstances, however, the Malay is not treacherous, and there are
many instances recorded in which men of this race have risked their
own lives on behalf of Europeans who chanced to be their friends.
As a race they are exceedingly courteous and self-respecting.
Their own code of manners is minute and strict, and they observe
its provisions faithfully. Unlike many Orientals, the Malays can
be treated with a friendly familiarity without such treatment
breeding lack of respect or leading to liberties being taken with the
superior. The Malays are indolent, pleasure-loving, improvident
beyond belief, fond of bright clothing, of comfort, of ease, and they
dislike toil exceedingly. They have no idea of the value of money,
and little notion of honesty where money is concerned. They would
always borrow rather than earn money, and they feel no shame in
adopting the former course. They will frequently refuse to work
for a wage when they most stand in need of cash, and yet at the
invitation of one who is their friend they will toil unremittingly
without any thought of reward. They are much addicted to gambling,
and formerly were much given to fighting, though they never
display that passion for war in the abstract which is characteristic
of some of the white races, and their courage on the whole is not
high if judged by European standards. It is notorious, however,
on the coasts that a Malay gang on board a ship invariably gets the
better of any fight which may arise between it and the Chinese crew.
The sexual morality of the Malays is very lax, but prostitution is
not common in consequence. Polygamy, though allowed by their
religion, is practised for the most part among the wealthy classes
only. The Malays are an intensely aristocratic people, and show a
marvellous loyalty to their rajas and chiefs. Their respect for rank
is not marred by any vulgarity or snobbery. The ruling classes
among them display all the vices of the lower classes, and few of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page477" id="page477"></a>477</span>
virtues except that of courtesy. They are for the most part, when left
to their own resources, cruel, unjust, selfish and improvident.</p>

<p>Much has been written concerning the acts of homicidal mania
called amuck (<i>amok</i>), which word in the vernacular means to attack.
It was formerly believed that these outbursts were to be attributed
to madness <i>pur et simple</i>, and some cases of <i>amok</i> can certainly be
traced to this source. These are not, however, in any sense typical,
and might equally have been perpetrated by men of another race.
The typical <i>amok</i> is usually the result of circumstances which render
a Malay desperate. The motive is often inadequate from the point
of view of a European, but to the Malay it is sufficient to make him
weary of life and anxious to court death. Briefly, where a man of
another race might not improbably commit suicide, a Malay runs
<i>amok</i>, killing all whom he may meet until he himself is slain.</p>

<p>The nervous affliction called <i>latah</i>, to which many Malays are
subject, is also a curious trait of the people. The victims of this
affliction lose for the time all self-control and all sense of their own
identity, imitating the actions of any person who chances to rivet
their attention. Accounts of these manifestations will be found
in Swettenham&rsquo;s <i>Malay Sketches</i> (London, 1895) and Clifford&rsquo;s
<i>Studies in Brown Humanity</i> (London, 1897).</p>

<p>The Malays wear a loose coat and trousers, and a cap or head-kerchief,
but the characteristic item of their costume is the <i>sarong</i>,
a silk or cotton cloth about two yards long by a yard
and a quarter wide, the ends of which are sewn together,
<span class="sidenote">Costume, Weapons, &amp;c.</span>
forming a kind of skirt. This is worn round the waist
folded in a knot, the women allowing it to fall to the
ankle, the men, when properly dressed in accordance with ancient
custom, folding it over the hilt of their waist-weapon, and draping
it around them so that it reaches nearly to the knee. In the hall
of a raja on state occasions a head-kerchief twisted into a peak is
worn, and the coat is furnished with a high collar extending round
the back of the neck only. This coat is open in front, leaving the
chest bare. The trousers are short and of a peculiar cut and material,
being coloured many hues in parallel horizontal lines. The <i>sarong</i>
is of Celebes manufacture and made of cotton, to the surface of which
a high polish is imparted by friction with a shell. The typical
fighting costume of the Malay is a sleeveless jacket with texts from
the Koran written upon it, short tight drawers reaching to the middle
of the thigh, and the <i>sarong</i> is then bound tightly around the waist,
leaving the hilt of the dagger worn in the girdle exposed to view.
The principal weapon of the Malays is the <i>kris</i>, a short dagger with
a small wooden or ivory handle, of which there are many varieties.
The blade of a <i>kris</i> may either be wavy or straight, but if wavy
the number of waves must always be uneven in number. The <i>kris</i>
most prized by the Malays are those of Bugis (Celebes) manufacture,
and of these the kind called <i>tuasek</i> are of the greatest value. Besides
the short <i>kris</i>, the Malays use long straight <i>kris</i> with very narrow
blades, shorter straight <i>kris</i> of the same form, short broad swords
called <i>sundang</i>, long swords of ordinary pattern called <i>pedang</i>,
somewhat shorter swords curved like scimitars with curiously
carved handles called <i>chenangkas</i>, and short stabbing daggers called
<i>tumbok lada</i>. The principal tools of the Malays are the <i>parang</i> or
<i>gôlok</i>, a heavy knife used in the jungle, without which no peasant
ever stirs abroad from his house, the <i>beliong</i> or native axe, and the
<i>pisau raut</i>, which is used for scraping rattan. Their implements are
very primitive, consisting of a plough fashioned from a fork of a
tree, and a rude harrow. Reaping is usually performed by the aid
of a curious little knife which severs each ear of grain separately.
The fisher-folk use many kinds of nets, which they manufacture
themselves. Sails, paddles, oars and punting-poles are all in use.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><span class="sc">Malay Language and Literature</span></p>

<p>The Malay language is a member of the Malayan section of the
Malayo-Polynesian class of languages, but it is by no means a
representative type of the section which has taken its name from it.
The area over which it is spoken comprises the peninsula of Malacca
with the adjacent islands (the Rhio-Lingga Archipelago), the greater
part of the coast districts of Sumatra and Borneo, the seaports of
Java, the Sunda and Banda Islands. It is the general medium of
communication throughout the archipelago from Sumatra to the
Philippine Islands, and it was so upwards of three hundred and fifty
years ago when the Portuguese first appeared in those parts.</p>

<p>There are no Malay manuscripts extant, no monumental records
with inscriptions in Malay, dating from before the spreading of
Islam in the archipelago, about the end of the 13th century. By
some it has been argued from this fact that the Malays possessed
no kind of writing prior to the introduction of the Arabic alphabet
(W. Robinson, J. J. de Hollander); whereas others have maintained,
with greater show of probability, that the Malays were in possession
of an ancient alphabet, and that it was the same as the Rechang
(Marsden, Friederich), as the Kawi (Van der Tuuk), or most like the
Lampong (Kern)&mdash;all of which alphabets, with the Battak, Bugi
and Macassar, are ultimately traceable to the ancient Cambojan
characters. With the Mahommedan conquest the Perso-Arabic
alphabet was introduced among the Malays; it has continued ever
since to be in use for literary, religious and business purposes. Where
Javanese is the principal language, Malay is sometimes found written
with Javanese characters; and in Palembang, in the M&#277;nangkabo
country of Middle Sumatra, the Rechang or Renchong characters
are in general use, so called from the sharp and pointed knife with
which they are cut on the smooth side of bamboo staves. It is only
since the Dutch have established their supremacy in the archipelago
that the Roman character has come to be largely used in writing and
printing Malay. This is also the case in the Straits Settlements.</p>

<p>By the simplicity of its phonetic elements, the regularity of its
grammatical structure, and the copiousness of its nautical vocabulary,
the Malay language is singularly well fitted to be the <i>lingua
franca</i> throughout the Indian archipelago. It possesses the five
vowels <i>a</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>o</i>, both short and long, and one pure diphthong, <i>au</i>.
Its consonants are <i>k</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>ng</i>, <i>ch</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>ñ</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>w</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>h</i>.
Long vowels can only occur in open syllables. The only possible
consonantal nexus in purely Malay words is that of a nasal and mute,
a liquid and mute and vice versa, and a liquid and nasal. Final
<i>k</i> and <i>h</i> are all but suppressed in the utterance. Purely Arabic
letters are only used in Arabic words, a great number of which have
been received into the Malay vocabulary. But the Arabic character
is even less suited to Malay than to the other Eastern languages
on which it has been foisted. As the short vowels are not marked,
one would, in seeing, <i>e.g.</i> the word <i>bntng</i>, think first of <i>bintang</i>, a
star; but the word might also mean a large scar, to throw down,
to spread, rigid, mutilated, enceinte, a kind of cucumber, a redoubt,
according as it is pronounced, <i>bantang</i>, <i>banting</i>, <i>bentang</i>, <i>buntang</i>,
<i>buntung</i>, <i>bunting</i>, <i>bonteng</i>, <i>benteng</i>.</p>

<p>Malay is essentially, with few exceptions, a dissyllabic language,
and the syllabic accent rests on the penultimate unless that syllable
is open and short; <i>e.g.</i> d&#257;tang, nam&#7845;ña, b&#277;sár, diumpatkanñ&#7845;lah.
Nothing in the form of a root word indicates the grammatical
category to which it belongs; thus, <i>k&#257;sih</i>, kindness, affectionate,
to love; <i>ganti</i>, a proxy, to exchange, instead of. It is only in derivative
words that this vagueness is avoided. Derivation is effected
by infixes, prefixes, affixes and reduplication. Infixes occur more
rarely in Malay than in the cognate tongues. Examples are&mdash;<i>g&#363;ruh</i>,
a rumbling noise, <i>gum&#363;ruh</i>, to make such a noise; <i>tunju&#7731;</i>,
to point, <i>telunju&#7731;</i>, the forefinger; <i>ch&#363;chuk</i>, to pierce, <i>cher&#363;chu&#7731;</i>,
a stockade. The import of the prefixes&mdash;m&#277; (m&#277;ng, m&#277;ñ, m&#277;n,
m&#277;m), p&#277; (p&#277;ng, p&#277;ñ, p&#277;n, p&#277;m b&#277;r (b&#277;l), p&#277;r, p&#277;l, ka, di, t&#277;r,&mdash;and
affixes&mdash;an, kan, i, lah&mdash;will best appear from the following examples&mdash;root
word <i>&#257;jar</i>, to teach, to learn; <i>m&#277;ng&#257;jar</i>, to instruct (expresses
an action); <i>bl&#277;&#257;jar</i>, to study (state or condition); <i>m&#277;ngaj&#257;ri</i>, to instruct
(some one, trans.); <i>m&#277;ng&#257;jarkan</i>, to instruct (in something,
causative); <i>p&#277;ng&#257;jar</i>, the instructor; <i>p&#277;l&#257;jar</i>, the learner; <i>p&#277;ngaj&#257;ran</i>,
the lesson taught, also the school; <i>p&#277;laj&#257;ran</i>, the lesson learnt; <i>di&#257;jar</i>,
to be learnt; <i>ter&#257;jar</i>, learnt; <i>t&#277;r&#257;jarkan</i>, taught; <i>t&#277;raj&#257;ri</i>, instructed;
<i>[p&#277;r&#257;ja</i> (from <i>r&#257;ja</i>, prince), to recognize as prince; <i>p&#277;raj&#257;kan</i>, to crown
as prince; karaj&#257;an, royalty]; <i>&#257;jarkanlah</i>, teach! Examples of
reduplication are&mdash;<i>&#257;jar-&#257;jar</i>, a sainted person; <i>&#257;jar-b&#277;r&#257;jar</i> (or
<i>b&#277;l&#257;jar</i>), to be learning and teaching by turns; similarly there are
forms like <i>&#257;jar-m&#277;ng&#257;jar</i>, <i>b&#277;r&#257;j&#257;r-aj&#257;ran</i>, <i>&#257;jar-aj&#257;ri</i>, <i>m&#277;mp&#277;r&#257;jar</i>,
<i>m&#277;mp&#277;r&#257;jarkan</i>, <i>m&#277;mp&#277;raj&#257;ri</i>, <i>t&#277;rb&#277;l&#257;jarkan</i>, <i>p&#277;rb&#277;l&#257;jarkan</i>, &amp;c.
Altogether there are upwards of a hundred possible derivative forms,
in the idiomatic use of which the Malays exhibit much skill. See
especially H. von Dewall, <i>De vormveranderingen der Maleische taal</i>
(Batavia, 1864) and I. Pijnappel, <i>Maleisch-Hollandsch Woordenboek</i>
(Amsterdam, 1875), &ldquo;Inleiding.&rdquo; In every other respect the language
is characterized by great simplicity and indefiniteness. There
is no inflexion to distinguish number, gender or case. Number is
never indicated when the sense is obvious or can be gathered from
the context; otherwise plurality is expressed by adjectives such as
<i>sag&#257;la</i>, all, and <i>b&#257;ñak</i>, many; more rarely by the repetition of the
noun, and the indefinite singular by <i>sa</i> or <i>s&#257;tu</i>, one, with a class-word.
Gender may, if necessary, be distinguished by the words <i>laki-l&#257;ki</i>,
male, and <i>p&#277;ramp&#363;an</i>, female, in the case of persons, and of <i>jantan</i>
and <i>b&#277;t&#299;na</i> in the case of animals. The genitive case is generally
indicated by the position of the word after its governing noun.
Also adjectives and demonstrative pronouns have their places after
the noun. Comparison is effected by the use of particles. Instead
of the personal pronouns, both in their full and abbreviated forms,
conventional nouns are in frequent use to indicate the social position
or relation of the respective interlocutors, as, <i>e.g.</i> <i>hamba tuan</i>, the
master&rsquo;s slave, <i>i.e.</i> I. These nouns vary according to the different
localities. Another peculiarity of Malay (and likewise of Chinese,
Shan, Talaing, Burmese and Siamese) is the use of certain class-words
or coefficients with numerals, such as <i>orang</i> (man), when speaking
of persons, <i>ekor</i> (tail) of animals, <i>k&#277;ping</i> (piece) of flat things, <i>b&#299;ji</i>
(seed) of roundish things; <i>e.g.</i> <i>l&#299;ma b&#299;ji, t&#277;lor</i>, five eggs. The number
of these class-words is considerable. Malay verbs have neither
person or number nor mood or tense. The last two are sometimes
indicated by particles or auxiliary verbs; but these are generally
dispensed with if the meaning is sufficiently plain without them.
The Malays avoid the building up of long sentences. The two
main rules by which the order of the words in a sentence is regulated
are&mdash;subject, verb, object; and qualifying words follow those which
they qualify. This is quite the reverse of what is the rule in Burmese.</p>

<p>The history of the Malays amply accounts for the number and
variety of foreign ingredients in their language. Hindus appear to
have settled in Sumatra and Java as early as the 4th century of our
era, and to have continued to exercise sway over the native
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page478" id="page478"></a>478</span>
populations for many centuries. These received from them into their
language a very large number of Sanskrit terms, from which we can
infer the nature of the civilizing influence imparted by the Hindu
rulers. Not only in words concerning commerce and agriculture,
but also in terms connected with social, religious and administrative
matters that influence is traceable in Malay. See W. E.
Maxwell, <i>Manual of the Malay Language</i> (1882), pp. 5-34, where
this subject is treated more fully than by previous writers. This
Sanskrit element forms such an integral part of the Malay vocabulary
that in spite of the subsequent infusion of Arabic and Persian
words adopted in the usual course of Mahommedan conquest it has
retained its ancient citizenship in the language. The number of
Portuguese, English, Dutch and Chinese words in Malay is not considerable;
their presence is easily accounted for by political or
commercial contact.</p>

<p>The Malay language abounds in idiomatic expressions, which constitute
the chief difficulty in its acquisition. It is sparing in the
use of personal pronouns, and prefers impersonal and elliptical
diction. As it is rich in specific expressions for the various aspects
of certain ideas, it is requisite to employ always the most appropriate
term suited to the particular aspect. In Maxwell&rsquo;s <i>Manual</i>,
pp. 120 seq., no less than sixteen terms are given to express the
different kinds of striking, as many for the different kinds of speaking,
eighteen for the various modes of carrying, &amp;c. An unnecessary
distinction has been made between <i>High Malay</i> and <i>Low Malay</i>.
The latter is no separate dialect at all, but a mere brogue or jargon,
the medium of intercourse between illiterate natives and Europeans
too indolent to apply themselves to the acquisition of the language
of the people; its vocabulary is made up of Malay words, with a
conventional admixture of words from other languages; and it varies,
not only in different localities, but also in proportion to the individual
speaker&rsquo;s acquaintance with Malay proper. A few words are
used, however, only in speaking with persons of royal rank&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>
<i>santap</i>, to eat (of a raja) instead of <i>m&#257;kan</i>; <i>b&#277;r&#257;du</i>, to sleep, instead
of t&#299;<i>dor</i>; <i>gring</i>, unwell, instead of <i>s&#257;kit</i>; <i>mangkat</i>, to die, instead of
<i>m&#257;ti</i>, &amp;c. The use is different as regards the term <i>J&#257;w&#299;</i> as applied
to the Malay language. This has its origin in the names Great
Java and Lesser Java, by which the medieval Java and Sumatra
were called, and it accordingly means the language spoken along the
coasts of the two great islands.</p>

<p>The Malays cannot, strictly speaking, be said to possess a literature,
for none of their writings can boast any literary beauty or value.
Their most characteristic literature is to be found, not
in their writings, but in the folk-tales which are transmitted
<span class="sidenote">Literature.</span>
orally from generation to generation, and repeated by the
wandering minstrels called by the people <i>P&#277;ng-l&#299;por L&#257;ra</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
&ldquo;Soothers of Care.&rdquo; Some specimens of these are to be found in
the <i>Journal of the Straits Branch of the Asiatic Society</i> (Singapore).
The collections of <i>Malay Proberbs</i> made by Klinkert, Maxwell and
Clifford also give a good idea of the literary methods of the Malays.
Their verse is of a very primitive description, and is chiefly used for
purposes of love-making. There are numerous rhymed fairy tales,
which are much liked by the people, but they are of no literary merit.
The best Malay books are the <i>Hik&#257;yat Hang T&#363;ak</i>, <i>B&#277;st&#257;mam</i> and the
<i>Hik&#257;yat Abdullah</i>. The latter is a diary of events kept during Sir
Stamford Raffle&rsquo;s administration by his Malay scribe.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALAY STATES<a name="ar123" id="ar123"></a></span> (<span class="sc">British</span>). The native states of the Malay
Peninsula under British protection are divided into two groups:
(1) federated, and (2) non-federated.</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><span class="sc">I.&mdash;Federated States</span></p>

<p>The federated states, under the protection of Great Britain,
but not British possessions, are Perak, Selangor and the confederation
of small states known as the Negri Sembilan (<i>i.e.</i> Nine
States) on the west coast, and the state of Pahang on the east
coast. Each state is under the rule of a sultan, who is assisted in
his legislative duties by a state council, upon which the resident,
and in some cases the secretary to the resident, has a seat, and
which is composed of native chiefs and one or more Chinese
members nominated by the sultan with the advice and consent
of the resident. The council, in addition to legislative and other
duties, revises all sentences of capital punishment. The administrative
work of each state is carried on by the resident and his
staff of European officials, whose ranks are recruited by successful
candidates in the competitive examinations held annually
by the Civil Service commissioners. The sultan of each state
is bound by treaty with the British government to accept the
advice of the resident, who is thus practically paramount; but
great deference is paid to the opinions and wishes of the sultans
and their chiefs, and the British officials are pledged not to
interfere with the religious affairs of the Mahommedan community.
In the actual administration of the Malay population
great use is made of the native aristocratic system, the peasants
being governed largely by their own chiefs, headmen and village
elders, under the close supervision of British district officers.
The result is a benevolent autocracy admirably adapted to local
conditions and to the character and traditions of the people.
A recognition of the fact that the welfare of the Malays, who are
the people of the land and whose sultans have never ceded their
territories to the British, must be regarded as the first consideration
has been the guiding principle of the administration of the
Malay States, and this has resulted in an extraordinary amelioration
of the condition of the natives, which has proceeded concurrently
with a notable development of the country and its
resources, mineral and agricultural. To the work of development,
however, the Malays have themselves contributed little,
sound administration having been secured by the British officials,
enterprise and capital having been supplied mainly by the
Chinese, and the labour employed being almost entirely Chinese
or Tamil. Meanwhile the Malays have improved their ancestral
holdings, have enjoyed a peace and a security to which their past
history furnishes no parallel, have obtained easy access to new
and important markets for their agricultural produce, and for
the rest have been suffered to lead the lives best suited to their
characters and their desires. Each principal department of
the administration has its federal head, and all the residents
correspond with and are controlled by the resident-general, who,
in his turn, is responsible to the high commissioner, the governor
of the Straits Settlements for the time being.</p>

<p>The estimated aggregate area of the Federated Malay States is
28,000 sq. m., and the estimated population in 1905 was 860,000,
as against 678,595 in 1901. Of these only about 230,000 are Malays.
The revenue of the federation in 1905 was $23,964,593 (about
£2,795,000), and the expenditure was $20,750,395 (about £2,460,000).
The imports for the same year were valued at $50,575,455 (about
£5,900,000), and the exports at $80,057,654 (about £9,340,000),
making a total trade of nearly 15¼ millions sterling. The principal
sources of revenue are an export duty on tin, the rents paid for the
revenue farms of the right to collect import duties on opium, wine and
spirits, and to keep licensed gambling-houses for the exclusive use
of the Chinese population, railway receipts, land and forest revenue
and postal revenue. The tin is won from large alluvial deposits
found in the states of the western seaboard, and the mines are worked
almost exclusively by Chinese capital and labour. Since 1889 the
Federated Malay States have produced considerably more than half
the tin of the world. Recently there has been a great development
in agricultural enterprise, especially with regard to rubber, which is
now grown in large quantities, the estates being mainly in the hands
of Europeans, and the labour mostly Tamil. The states are opened
up by over 2500 m. of some of the best metalled cart-roads in the
world, and by a railway system, 350 m. of which, extending from the
mainland opposite Penang to the ancient town of Malacca, are open
to traffic. Another 150 m. of railway is under construction. The
government offices at Kuala Lumpor, the federal capital of the states,
are among the finest buildings of the kind in Asia. The whole of
this extraordinary development, it should be noted, has been
effected by careful, sound and wise administration coupled with a
courageous and energetic policy of expenditure upon public works.
Throughout, not one penny of debt has been incurred, the roads,
railways, &amp;c., being constructed entirely from current balances.
This of course has only been rendered possible by the extraordinary
mineral wealth which the states on the western seaboard have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page479" id="page479"></a>479</span>
developed in the hands of Chinese miners amid the peace and security
which British rule has brought to these once lawless lands. The
value of the tin output for the year 1905 amounted to $69,460,993
(£8,104,199). Although agricultural enterprise in the Malay States
is assuming considerable proportions and a growing importance,
the total value of the principal agricultural products, including
timber, for the year 1905 only aggregated $2,435,513 (£289,143).</p>

<p>The whole of the Malay Peninsula is one vast forest, through which
flow countless streams that form one of the most lavish water-systems
in the world. The rivers, though many of them are of
imposing appearance and of considerable length, are uniformly
shallow, only a few on the west coast being navigable by ships
for a distance of some 40 m. from their mouths. In spite of the
notable development above referred to, only a very small fraction of
the entire area of the states has as yet been touched either by mining
or agricultural enterprise. It is not too much to assert that the
larger half of the forest-lands has never been trodden by the foot of
man. (For information concerning the botany, geology, &amp;c., of the
Malay States see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Malay Peninsula</a></span>. For the ethnology see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Malays</a></span>.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sc">Perak</span> is situated between the parallels 3° 37&prime; and 6° 5&prime; N.
and 100° 3&prime; to 101° 51&prime; E. on the western side of the Malay
Peninsula. It is bounded on the N. by the British possession
of Province Wellesley and the Malay state of Kedah; on the
S. by the protected native state of Selangor; on the E. by the
protected native state of Pahang and the independent states of
Kelantan and Petani; and on the W. by the Straits of Malacca.
The coast-line is about 90 m. in length. The extreme distance
from the most northerly to the most southerly portions of the
state is about 172 m., and the greatest breadth from east to
west is about 100 m. The total area of the country is estimated
at about 10,000 sq. m.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Perak river, which runs in a southerly direction almost parallel
with the coast for nearly 150 m. of its course, is navigable for small
steamers for about 40 m. from its mouth, and by native trading boats
for nearly 200 m. The Plus, Batang, Padang and Kinta rivers
are its principal tributaries, all of them falling into the Perak on its
left bank. The other principal rivers of the state are the Krian,
Kurau, Larut and Bruas to the north of the mouth of the Perak,
and the Bernam to the south. None of these rivers is of any great
importance as a waterway, although the Bernam River is navigable
for small steamers for nearly 100 m. of its course. The mountain
ranges, which cover a considerable area, run from the north-east to
the south-west. The highest altitudes attained by them do not
exceed 7500 ft., but they average about 2500 ft. They are all
thickly covered with jungle. The ranges are two, running parallel
to one another, with the valley of the Perak between them. The
larger is a portion of the main chain, which runs down the peninsula
from north to south. The lesser is situated in the district of Larut.
There are several hill sanatoria in the state at heights which vary
from 2500 to 4700 ft. above sea-level, but the extreme humidity of
the atmosphere renders the coolness thus obtainable the reverse of
enjoyable.</p>

<p>Mr Leonard Wray, curator of the Perak museum, writes as follows
on the subject of the geological formation of the state: &ldquo;There
are really only four formations represented&mdash;firstly,
the granitic rocks; secondly, a large series of beds of
<span class="sidenote">Geology.</span>
gneiss, quartzite, schist and sandstone, overlaid in many places
by thick beds of crystalline limestone; thirdly, small sheets of trap
rock; and fourthly, river-gravels and other Quaternary deposits.
The granites are of many varieties, and also, in all probability, of
several different geological periods. The series of quartzites, schists,
and limestone are of great age, but as no fossils have ever been found
in any of them, nothing definite can be stated as to their exact
chronological position. Their lithological characteristics and the
total absence of all organic remains point to the Archaean period.
The failure to discover signs of life in them is, of course, merely
negative evidence, and the finding of a single fossil would at once
upset it. However, until this happens they may be conveniently
classed as Laurentian. It is at present impossible to form anything
approaching an accurate estimate of the thickness of this extensive
series, but it is probable that it is somewhere between 4000 and
5000 ft. Unconformability has been noticed between the limestones
and the beds beneath, but whether this is sufficient to separate them
or not is a matter for future investigation.... The taller hills
are exclusively composed of granite, as also are some of the lower
ones.... The ores of the following metals have been found in
the formations named: Granite&mdash;tin, lead, iron, arsenic, tungsten
and titanium; Laurentian&mdash;tin, gold, lead, silver, iron, arsenic,
copper, zinc, tungsten, manganese and bismuth; Quaternary&mdash;tin,
gold, copper, tungsten, iron and titanium. This is not to be considered
a complete list, as small quantities of other metals have also
been found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The early history of Perak is obscure, the only information on the
subject being obtained from native traditions, which are altogether
untrustworthy. According to these authorities, however, a settlement
was first made by Malays in Perak at Bruas, and the capital
<span class="sidenote">History.</span>
was later moved to the banks of the Perak River, the site chosen
being a little village called Temong, which lies some miles
up stream from Kuala Kangsar, the present residence
of the sultan. When the Malacca sultanate fell, owing to the invasion
of the Portuguese in 1511, a member of that royal house is said to
have migrated to Perak, and the present dynasty claims to have been
descended from him. As this boast is also made by almost every
ruling family in the peninsula, the tradition is not worthy of any
special attention. What is more certain is the tradition that Perak
was twice invaded by the Achinese, and its rulers carried off into
captivity, one of them, Sultan Mansur Shah, subsequently becoming
the ruler of Achin. The first European settlement in Perak was made
by the Dutch in 1650, under a treaty entered into with the Achinese,
but the natives of the country rose against the Dutch again and again,
and it was abandoned in 1783, though it was afterwards reoccupied,
the Dutch being finally ejected by the British in 1795. In 1818
the Siamese conquered Perak, but its independence was secured
by a treaty between the British and Siamese governments in 1824.
From that date until 1874 Perak was ruled by its own sultans, but
in that year, owing to internal strife, Sultan Abdullah applied to
the then governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir Andrew Clarke, for
the assistance of a British Resident. The treaty of Pangkor was
concluded on the 20th of January 1874, and the first resident,
Mr J. W. W. Birch, was murdered on the 2nd of November 1875.
A punitive expedition became necessary; sultan Abdullah and the
other chiefs concerned in the murder were banished, the actual
murderers were hanged, and Raja Muda Jusuf was declared regent.
He died in 1888, and was succeeded by the sultan Raja Idris,
K.C.M.G., a most enlightened ruler, who was from the first a strong
and intelligent advocate of British methods of administration. Sir
Hugh Low was appointed resident, a position which he held until
1889, when he was succeeded by Sir Frank Swettenham. Since
then the history of Perak has been one of continuous peace and
growing prosperity and wealth. Although the federal capital is
Kuala Lumpor in Selangor, Perak still enjoys the honour of being
the senior and leading state of the federation.</p>

<p>By the census taken on the 5th of April 1891 the population of
Perak was shown to be as follows: Europeans, 366; Eurasians,
Jews and Armenians, 293; Malays, 96,719; Chinese,
94,345; Tamils, 13,086; aborigines, 5779; other nationalities,
<span class="sidenote">Population.</span>
3666; thus making a grand total of 214,254, of whom
156,408 were males and 57,846 were females. The estimated
population in 1905 was 400,000, of whom 200,000 were Chinese and
160,000 were Malays, but owing to the disparity of the proportions
between the sexes the deaths in each year largely outnumber the
births, and the increase in the population is accounted for solely by
the number of immigrants, chiefly from the mainland of China, and
to a lesser extent from India also.</p>

<p>The revenue of Perak in 1874 amounted to $226,333. That for
1905 amounted to $12,242,897. Of this latter sum $4,876,400 was
derived from duty on exported tin, $2,489,300 from railway receipts,
$505,300 from land revenue and $142,800 from postal and telegraphic
revenue. The remainder is mainly derived from the revenue farms,
which are leased to Chinese capitalists for a short term of years,
conveying to the lessee the right to collect import duties upon
opium, wine and spirits, to keep pawnbroking shops, and to keep
public licensed gambling-houses for the use of Chinese only. The
expenditure for 1905 amounted to $10,141,980. Of this sum
$4,236,000 was expended upon railway upkeep and construction
and $2,176,100 upon public works. The value of the imports
into Perak during 1905 was over $20,000,000, and that of the exports
exceeded $40,000,000, making a total of over $60,000,000,
equivalent to about seven million sterling. The output of tin from
Perak ranged between 18,960 tons, valued at $23,099,506 in 1899,
and 26,600 tons, valued at $35,500,000, in 1905. The fluctuating
character of the output is due, not to any exhaustion of the mineral
deposits of the state&mdash;that is not to be anticipated for many years
yet to come&mdash;but to the uncertainty of the labour supply. The
mining population is recruited exclusively from the districts of
southern China, and during certain years an increased demand for
labourers in China itself, in French Indo-China, in the Dutch colonies,
and in South Africa temporarily and adversely affected immigration
to the Straits of Malacca. The output has, moreover, been
affected from time to time by the price of tin, which was $32.20 per
pikul in 1896, rose to $42.96 in 1898, to $74.15 in 1900, and averaged
$80.60 in 1905. Exclusive of tin, the principal exports were
$108,000 worth of Para rubber, $181,000 of copra, $54,000 of hides,
$48,000 of patchouli, and considerable quantities of timber, rattans
and other jungle produce. The agricultural development of the
state is still in its infancy, but rubber is cultivated in rapidly increasing
areas, and the known fertility of the soil, the steady and regular
rainfall, the excellent means of communication, and the natural and
artificial conditions of the country, justify the expectation that the
future of Perak as an agricultural country will be prosperous.</p>

<p>Although so much has been done to develop the resources of Perak,
by far the greater portion of the state is still covered by dense and
virgin forest. In 1898 it was calculated that only 330,249 acres of
land were occupied or cultivated out of a total acreage of 6,400,000.
<span class="sidenote">General.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page480" id="page480"></a>480</span>
The area of agricultural holdings has notably increased, but a considerable
period must yet elapse before it will amount to even one-tenth
of the whole. A line of railway connects the port
of Teluk Anson with the great mining district of Kinta,
whence the line runs, crossing the Perak River at Enggor, to Kuala
Kangsar, the residence of the sultan, thence to Taiping, the administrative
capital of the state, and via Krian to a point opposite to the
island of Penang. A second line runs south from Perak and connects
with the railway system of Selangor, which in its turn connects with
the Negri Sembilan and Malacca line, thus giving through railway
communication between the last-named town and Penang. Perak
also possesses some 600 miles of excellent metalled cart-road, and the
length of completed road is annually increasing.</p>

<p>For administrative purposes the state is divided into six districts:
Upper Perak, Kuala Kangsar and Lower Perak, on the Perak River;
Kinta; Batany Padang and Larut and Krian. Of these, Larut and
Kinta are the principal mining centres, while Krian is the most
prosperous agricultural district. The districts on the Perak River
are mostly peopled by Malays. The administrative capital is
Taiping, the chief town of Larut. Kuala Kangsar is chiefly memorable
as having been the scene of the first federal meeting of native
chiefs, who, with the British Residents from each state, met together
in 1897 for friendly discussion of their common interests for the first
time in history, under the auspices of the high commissioner, Sir
Charles H. B. Mitchell. This, in the eyes of those who are acquainted
with the character of the Malays and of the relations which formerly
subsisted between the rulers of the various states, is perhaps the most
signal token of the changes which British influence has wrought in
the peninsula.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sc">Selangor</span> is situated between the parallels 2° 32&prime; and 3° 37&prime; N.
and 100° 38&prime; and 102° E., on the western side of the Malay
Peninsula. It is bounded on the N. by the protected native
state of Perak, on the S. by the protected states of the Negri
Sembilan, on the E. by Pahang and the Negri Sembilan, and
on the W. by the Straits of Malacca. The coast-line is about
100 m. in length, greatest length about 104 m., and greatest
breadth about 48 m., total area estimated at about 3000
sq. m.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The state consists of a narrow strip of land between the mountain
range which forms the backbone of the peninsula and the Straits of
Malacca. Compared with other states in the peninsula, Selangor
is poorly watered. The principal rivers are the Selangor, the Klang
and the Langat. The principal port of the state is Port Swettenham,
situated at the mouth of the Klang River, and is connected with the
capital, Kuala Lumpor, by a railway. The geology of the state
closely resembles that of Perak. The state is possessed of most
valuable deposits of alluvial tin, and mining for this metal is the chief
industry of the population. Kuala Lumpor is also the federal
capital of the Malay States.</p>

<p>According to native tradition, the ruling house of Selangor is
descended from a Bugis raja, who, with two of his brothers, settled
in the state in 1718, the son of the youngest brother
eventually becoming ruler of the country. In 1783 the
<span class="sidenote">History.</span>
then sultan of Selangor joined with the Iang-di-per-Tuan Muda of
Riau in an unsuccessful attack upon the Dutch who then held
Malacca. In retaliation the Dutch, under Admiral Van Braam,
invaded Selangor and drove the sultan out of his country. In
1785, aided by the Bendahara of Pahang, Sultan Ibrahim of Selangor
reconquered his state; but the Dutch blockaded his ports, and eventually
forced him to enter into a treaty whereby he consented to
acknowledge their sovereignty. The earliest British political
communication with Selangor began in 1818, when a commercial
treaty was concluded with the governor of Penang. In 1867 Sultan
Abdul Samad of Selangor appointed his son-in-law, Tungku Dia
Udin, to be viceroy; and this gave rise to a civil war which lasted
almost without intermission till 1873, when the enemies of Tungku
Dia Udin were finally vanquished, largely by the agency of the
Bendahara of Pahang, who, at the invitation of the governor of the
Straits Settlements, sent a warlike expedition to the assistance of
the viceroy. In 1874 the occurrence of an atrocious act of piracy
off the mouth of the Langat River led to the governor, Sir Andrew
Clarke, appointing, at the request of the sultan, a British Resident
to aid him in the administration of his kingdom. Since that date
there has been no further breach of the peace, and the prosperity
of Selangor has increased annually.</p>

<p>By the census taken on the 5th of April 1891 the population of
Selangor was given at 81,592 souls, of whom 67,051 were males and
only 14,541 were females. The census taken on the 5th of April
1901 gave a total population of 168,789 souls, of whom 136,823 were
males and 31,966 females. Of these 108,768 were Chinese, 33,997
were Malays, 16,748 were Tamils, and only 487 were Europeans.
The returns deal with nearly a score of different nationalities. Since
1901 the population has been much increased and now certainly
exceeds 200,000 souls. Now, however, that instead of a single port
of entry there exist easy means of access to the state by rail both
from the north and the south, it is no longer possible to estimate
the annual increase by immigration with any approach to accuracy.
It will be noted that the inhabitants of this erstwhile Malayan state
were, even at the time of the census of 1901, over 64% Chinese,
while the Malays were little more than 20% of the population.
In Selangor, as elsewhere in the Malay Peninsula, the deaths annually
far outnumber the births recorded (<i>e.g.</i> in 1905 births 8293, deaths
12,500). The disproportion of the female to the male sections of the
population is greater in Selangor than in any other part of the colony
or Malay States. The development of planting enterprise in Selangor,
and more especially the cultivation of rubber, has led during
recent years to the immigration of a considerable number of Tamil
coolies, but the Tamil population is still insignificant as compared
with the Chinese.</p>

<p>The revenue of Selangor in 1875 amounted to only $115,656;
in 1905 it had increased to $8,857,793. Of this latter sum $3,195,318
was derived from duty on tin exported, $1,972,628 from
federal receipts, and $340,360 from land revenue. The
<span class="sidenote">Finance, Trade, &amp;c.</span>
balance is chiefly derived from the revenue farms,
which include the right to collect import duty on opium and spirits.
The expenditure for 1905 amounted to $7,186,146, of which sum
$3,717,238 was on account of federal charges and $1,850,711 for
public works. The value of the imports in 1905 was $24,643,619
and that of the exports was $26,683,316, making a total of
$51,326,935, equivalent to £5,988,000. Tin is the principal export.
The amount exported in 1905 was 17,254 tons. The total area of
alienated mining land at the end of 1905 amounted to 65,573 acres,
and it was estimated that over 60,000 Chinese were employed in
the mines.</p>

<p>The main trunk line of the Federated Malay States railways
passes through Selangor. It enters the state at Tanjong Malim
on the Perak boundary, runs southward through Kuala Lumpor and
so into the Negri Sembilan. It runs for 81 m. in Selangor territory.
A branch line 27 m. long connects Kuala Lumpor with Port Swettenham
on the Klang Straits where extensive wharves, capable of
accommodating ocean-going vessels, have been constructed. A
second branch line, measuring rather more than 4 m. in length,
has been opened to traffic. It connects the caves at Batu with
Kuala Lumpor. Frequent communication is maintained by
steamer between Port Swettenham and Singapore, and by coasting
vessels between the former port and those on the shores of the
Straits of Malacca. All the principal places in the state are connected
with one another by telegraph.</p>

<p>For administrative purposes Selangor is divided into six districts:
Kuala Lumpor, in which the capital and the principal tin-fields
are situated; Ulu Selangor, which is also a prosperous mining
district; Kuala Selangor, which is agricultural, and poorly populated
by Malays; Ulu Langat, mining and agricultural; Kuala Langat,
the residence of the late sultan Abdul Samad, agricultural; and
Klang, the only prosperous port of the state. Much money has been
expended upon the capital, Kuala Lumpor, which possesses some
fine public buildings, waterworks, &amp;c., and where the principal
residence of the Resident-General is situated. In some sort Kuala
Lumpor is the capital not only of Selangor, but also of the whole
federation. Its scenery is very attractive.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sc">Negri Sembilan</span> (the Nine States) is a federation of small
native states which is now treated as a single entity, being under
the control of a British Resident, and is situated between parallels
2° 28&prime; and 3° 18&prime; N. and 101° 45&prime; and 102° 45&prime; E., on the western
side of the Malay Peninsula. It is bounded on the N. by the
protected state of Pahang, on the S. by the territory of Malacca,
on the E. by Pahang and the independent state of Johor, and on
the W. by the Straits of Malacca. The coast-line is about 28 m.
in length, and the extreme distance from north to south is 55 m.,
and that from east to west about 65 m. The estimated area is
about 3000 sq. m. Port Dickson, or Arang-Arang, is the only
port on the coast. It is connected with the capital, Seremban,
by a railway 24 m. in length. Most of the states comprising the
federation depend largely for their prosperity upon agriculture,
but in some of the districts tin is being worked in considerable
quantities, with good results.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>As is the case with the history of most Malayan states, much
rests upon no surer ground than tradition, in so far as the records
of the Negri Sembilan are concerned. At the same time
the native story that the states which now form the
<span class="sidenote">History.</span>
federation of the Negri Sembilan were originally peopled by tribes
of Sakai, or aborigines of the peninsula, who descended from the
mountains of the interior and peopled the valleys, is supported by
much corroborative evidence. Not only does the Malay&rsquo;s contempt
for the Sakai make it exceedingly unlikely that the tradition, which
is hardly a matter for pride, should have been preserved if it were not
true, but also many of the laws and customs in force in these states
are wholly foreign to those of the Malays, and can plainly be traced
to the aborigines. As an instance, the custom of inheriting rank and
property through the mother instead of through the father may be
mentioned. Tradition further relates that towards the end of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page481" id="page481"></a>481</span>
18th century a raja of the royal house of Menangkabu came from
Sumatra to rule over the federation of small states, each of which
continued to be governed in all its local affairs by its own chief and
by the village and other councils sanctioned by ancient custom. The
Sumatran raja took the title of Iang-di-per-Tuan of Sri Menanti.
Although they bore the name of the &ldquo;Nine States,&rdquo; only six seem
to have belonged to the federation during the time of which history
speaks. These are Sri Menanti, Johol, Tampin, Rembau, Jelebu,
and Sungei Ujong. Later the two latter separated themselves
from the confederation. Ancient tradition says that the names of
the nine states were originally Klang, Jelebu, Sungei Ujong, Johol,
Segamat, Pasir Besar, Naning, Rembau and Jelai. Of these Klang
was annexed by Selangor, Segamat and Pasir Besar by Johor, and
Naning by Malacca. During the last years of the 18th century
the Iang-di-per-Tuan appointed an Iang-di-per-Tuan Muda to rule
Rembau, and the state of Tampin was created to provide for the
family of the new chief. In 1887 the governor of the Straits Settlements
sent Mr Martin Lister to the Negri Sembilan, which had
become disintegrated, and by his influence the ancient federal
system was revived under the control of a Resident appointed by
the governor. The states which formed this new confederation
were Johol, Ulu Muar, Jempol, Terachi, Inas, Gunong Pasir, Rembau,
Tampin and Gemencheh. Prior to this, in 1873, owing to a civil
war in Sungei Ujong, Sir Andrew Clarke sent a military force to
that state, put an end to the disturbances, and placed the country
under the control of a British Resident. Jelebu was taken under
British protection in 1886, and was thenceforth managed by a magistrate
under the orders of the Resident of Sungei Ujong. In 1896,
when the federation of all the Malayan states under British control
was effected, Sungei Ujong and Jelebu were reunited to the confederation
of small states from which they had so long been separated
and the whole, under the old name of the Negri Sembilan, or Nine
States, was placed under one Resident.</p>

<p>The population of the Negri Sembilan, which according to the
census taken in April 1891 was only 70,730, had increased to 96,028
by 1901, and was estimated at 119,454 in 1905. Of these 46,500
are Chinese, 65,000 Malays, 6700 Tamils, and 900 Europeans and
Eurasians. The births registered slightly exceed the deaths in
number, there being a large Malay population in the Negri Sembilan
among whom the proportion of women to men is fair, a condition of
things not found in localities where the inhabitants are mostly
Chinese immigrants.</p>

<p>The revenue of the Negri Sembilan amounted to only $223,435
in 1888. In 1898 it had increased to $701,334, in 1900 to $1,251,366,
and in 1905 to $2,335,534. The revenue for 1905 was
derived mainly as follows:&mdash;customs $1,268,602, land
<span class="sidenote">Finance and Trade.</span>
revenue $145,475, land sales $21,407, while the revenue
farms contributed $584,459. The expenditure in 1905 amounted
to $2,214,093, of which $1,125,355 was expended upon public works.
The trade returns for 1905, which are not, however, complete, show
an aggregate value of about $13,000,000. The value of the tin
exported during 1905 exceeded $6,900,000, and the value of the
agricultural produce, of which gambier represented $211,000 and
damar $80,000, amounted to $407,990.</p>

<p>Seremban, the administrative capital of the Negri Sembilan,
is connected with Port Dickson by a railway line, owned by the
Sungei Ujong Railway Company, which is 24½ m. in
length. It is also situated on the trunk line of the
<span class="sidenote">General.</span>
Federated Malay States, and is thus joined by rail to Selangor on the
north and to Malacca on the south. Frequent steam communication
is maintained between Port Dickson and the ports on the Straits
of Malacca and with Singapore.</p>

<p>For administrative purposes the Negri Sembilan is divided into
five districts, viz. the Seremban District, the Coast District, Jelebu,
Kuala Pilah and Tampin. Each of these is under the charge of
a European district officer, who is responsible to the Resident.
The Iang-di-per-Tuan lives at Kuala Pilah, but the capital of the
federation is at Seremban in Sungei Ujong, where the Resident is
stationed. The hereditary chiefs of the various states aid in the
government of their districts, and have seats upon the state council,
over which the Iang-di-per-Tuan presides. The watering-place
of Magnolia Bay, where excellent sea-bathing is obtainable, is one
of the pleasure resorts of this part of the peninsula.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sc">Pahang</span>, on the east coast of the peninsula, is situated between
parallels 2° 28&prime; and 3° 45&prime; N. and 101° 30&prime; and 103° 30&prime; E. It is
bounded on the N. by the independent native states of Kelantan
and Trengganu; on the S. by the Negri Sembilan and Johor; on
the E. by the China Sea; and on the W. by the protected states
of Perak and Selangor. The coast-line is about 112 m. in length;
the greatest length is about 210 m., and greatest breadth about
130 m. The state is the largest in the peninsula, its area being
estimated at 15,000 sq. m. The ports on the coast are the mouths
of the Endau, Rompin, Pahang and Kuantan rivers, but during
the north-east monsoon the coast is not easy of approach,
and the rivers, all of which are guarded by difficult bars, are
impossible of access except at high tides.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The principal river of the state is the Pahang, from which it takes
its name. At a distance of 180 m. from the coast this river is formed
by two others named respectively the Jelai and the Tembeling.
The former is joined 20 m. farther up stream by the Lipis, which has
its rise in the mountains which form the boundary with Perak.
The Jelai itself has its rise also in a more northerly portion of this
range, while its two principal tributaries above the mouth of the
Lipis, the Telom and the Serau, rise, the one in the plateau which
divides Perak from Pahang, the other in the hills which separate
Pahang from Kelantan. The Tembeling has its rise in the hills
which divide Pahang from Kelantan, but some of its tributaries
rise on the Trengganu frontier, while the largest of its confluents
comes from the hills in which the Kuantan River takes its rise. The
Pahang is navigable for large boats as far as Kuala Lipis, 200 m.
from the mouth, and light-draught launches can also get up to that
point. Smaller boats can be taken some 80 m. higher up the
Jelai and Telom. The river, however, as a waterway is of little
use, since it is uniformly shallow. The Rompin and Kuantan
rivers are somewhat more easily navigated for the first 30 m. of their
course, but taken as a whole the waterways of Pahang are of little
value. The interior of Pahang is chiefly noted for its auriferous
deposits. Gunong Tahan is situated on the boundary between
Pahang and Kelantan. Its height is estimated at 8000 ft. above
sea-level, but it has never yet been ascended. Pahang, like the states
on the west coast, is covered almost entirely by one vast forest,
but in the Lipis valley, which formerly was thickly populated, there
is a considerable expanse of open grass plain unlike anything to be
seen on the western seaboard. The coast is for the most part a
sandy beach fringed with <i>casuarina</i> trees and there are only a few
patches of mangrove-swamp throughout its entire length.</p>

<p>The ancient name of Pahang was Indrapura. It is mentioned in
the history of <i>Hang Tuah</i>, the great Malacca brave, who flourished in
the 16th century, and succeeded in abducting a daughter
of the then ruling house of Pahang for his master, the
<span class="sidenote">History.</span>
sultan of Malacca. Prior to this, Pahang had been ruled by the
Siamese. When Malacca fell into the hands of the Portuguese in
1511 the sultan, Muhammad Shah, fled to Pahang, and the present
ruling house claims to have been descended from him. The title
of the ruler of Pahang was Bendahara until 1882, when the present
(1902) ruler, Wan Ahmad, assumed the title of sultan, taking the
name of Sultan Ahmad Maatham Shah. Up to that time the Bendahara
had been installed on his accession by the sultan of Riau, and
held his office by virtue of that chief&rsquo;s letter of authority. About
1855 the father of the present sultan died at Pekan, and his son
Bendahara Korish, who succeeded him, drove Wan Ahmad from
the country. After making three unsuccessful attempts to conquer
the land and to dethrone his elder brother, Wan Ahmad at last
succeeded in 1865 in invading the state and wresting the throne
from his nephew, who had succeeded his father some years earlier.
From that time, in spite of two attempts to shake his power by
invasions from Selangor which were undertaken by his nephews
Wan Aman and Wan Da, Bendahara Ahmad ruled his country with
a rod of iron. In 1887 he consented to enter into a treaty with the
governor of the Straits by which he accepted a consular agent at his
court. This treaty was finally signed on the 8th of October 1887.
In February of the following year a Chinese British subject was
murdered at Pekan in circumstances which pointed to the responsibility
of the sultan for the crime, and in October 1888 a Resident
was appointed to assist the sultan in the administration of his country,
that being, in the opinion of the British government, the only
guarantee for the safety of the life and property of British subjects
which it could accept. In December 1891 disturbances broke out
in Pahang, the nominal leaders of which were certain of the sultan&rsquo;s
most trusted chiefs. The sultan himself took no part in the outbreak,
but it undoubtedly had his sympathy, even if it was not
caused by his direct commands. The rebels were driven to seek
safety in flight in November 1892, but in June 1894 they gathered
strength for a second disturbance, and raided Pahang from Kelantan,
in which state they had been given shelter by the Mahommedan
rulers. This event, added to the occurrence of other raids from across
the border, led to an irregular expedition being led into Trengganu
and Kelantan by the Resident of Pahang (Mr Hugh Clifford) in 1895,
and this had the desired result. The rebel chiefs were banished to
Siam, and no further breach of the peace has troubled the tranquillity
of Pahang since that time. Pahang joined the Federated
Malay States by a treaty signed in 1895, and the sultan and his
principal chiefs were present at the federal durbar held at Kuala
Kangsar in Perak in 1897.</p>

<p>The census taken in April 1901 gave the total population of Pahang
at 84,113, of whom 73,462 were Malays, 8695 Chinese, 1227 Tamils
and other natives of India, 180 Europeans and Eurasians,
and 549 people of other nationalities. The population
<span class="sidenote">Population.</span>
in 1905 was estimated at 100,000, the increase being due to immigration
mainly from the states on the western seaboard. In former days
Pahang was far more thickly populated than in modern times,
but the long succession of civil wars which racked the land after the
death of Bendahara Ali caused thousands of Pahang Malays to fly
the country. To-day the valley of the Lebir River in Kelantan and
the upper portions of several rivers near the Perak and Selangor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page482" id="page482"></a>482</span>
boundaries are inhabited by Pahang Malays, the descendants of
these fugitives. The Pahang natives are almost all engaged in
agriculture. The work of the mines, &amp;c., is performed by Chinese
and foreign Malays. In the Lipis valley the descendants of the
Rawa Malays, who at one time possessed the whole of the interior
in defiance of the Pahang rajas, still outnumber the people of the
land.</p>

<p>The revenue of Pahang in 1899 amounted to only $62,077; in
1900 to $419,150. In 1905 it was $528,368. The expenditure in
1905 amounted to $1,208,176. Of this sum $736,886 was expended
on public works. Pahang is still a source of expense
<span class="sidenote">Finance and Trade.</span>
to the federation, its progress having been retarded
by the disturbances which lasted from December 1891
until 1895, with short intervals of peace, but the revenue is
now steadily increasing, and the ultimate financial success of the
state is considered to be secure. Pahang owes something over
$3,966,500 to Selangor and $1,175,000 to Perak, which have
financed it now for some years out of surplus revenue. The value
of the imports in 1905 was $1,344,346, that of the exports was
$3,838,928, thus making a total trade value of $5,183,274. The
most valuable export is tin, the value of which in 1905 amounted
to $2,820,745. The value of the gutta exported exceeded $140,000,
that of dried and salted fish amounted to nearly $70,000, and that
of timber to $325,000.</p>

<p>The geological formation of the states lying to the eastward of
the main range of mountains which splits the peninsula in twain
differs materially from that of the western states. At
a distance of about a dozen miles from the summits of
<span class="sidenote">General.</span>
the mountains the granite formation is replaced by slates, which in
many places are intersected by fissures of quartz, and in others are
overlaid by vast thicknesses of limestone. Those of the quartz
fissures which have been exploited are found to be auriferous, and
several mining companies have attempted to work the deposits.
Their efforts, however, have not hitherto been successful. A magnificent
road over the mountains, with a ruling grade of 1 in 30, joins
Kuala Lipis, the administrative capital of Pahang, to Kuala Kubu,
the nearest railway station in Selangor. The road measures 82 m.
in length. Pekan, where the sultan has his residence, was the capital
of Pahang until the middle of 1898, when the administrative headquarters
were transferred to the interior as being more central.
None of these towns is of any size or importance. In the Kuantan
valley, which lies parallel to the Pahang River, a European company
is working tin lodes with considerable success. These lodes are the
only mines of the kind being worked in the Federated Malay States.
Pahang is fertile and well suited for agriculture of many kinds.
The rainfall is heavy and regular. The climate is cooler than that
of the west coast, and the full force of the monsoon is felt from
October to February in each year. For administrative purposes
Pahang is divided into four districts&mdash;Ulu Pahang, in which the
present capital is situated; Temerloh, which includes 80 odd miles
of the Pahang valley and the Semantan River; Pekan, which includes
the coast rivers down to Endau; and Kuantan. Each of these is
under the charge of a district officer, who is responsible to the
resident. The boundary with Johor and the Negri Sembilan was
rectified by a commission which sat in London in 1897-1898.</p>

<p>In 1909 a treaty was made between Great Britain and Siam,
one provision of which was the cession to the former of the
suzerain rights enjoyed by the latter over certain territories in
the Malay Peninsula. These territories consisted of the four
Siamese Malay States: Kelantan, Trengganu, Kedah and Perlis,
very ancient dependencies of Siam, all of which except Trengganu,
were in a flourishing condition and had been administered by
British officers in the service of Siam for some years prior to their
transference. Though the four states were loyal to Siam and
wished to retain their former allegiance, the change was effected
without disturbance of any kind, the British government on
assuming the rights of suzerainty placing an adviser at the court
of each raja and guaranteeing the continuance of the administration
on the lines already laid down by Siam so far as might be
compatible with justice and fair treatment for all. The four
states lie to the north of the Federated Malay States, two on the
east and two on the west side of the peninsula.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Kelantan.</span>&mdash;This state on the east coast, bounded N. and
N.E. by the China Sea, E. by Trengganu, S. by Pahang and W.
by Perak and Ra-ngé, lies between 4° 48&prime; and 6° 20&prime; N. and
101° 33&prime; and 102° 45&prime; E. The greatest length from north to
south is 115 m. and the greatest breadth from east to west 60 m.
The area is about 5000 sq. m. The northern part of the state is
flat and fertile, but the southern district which comprises more
than half the total area, is mountainous and uncultivated.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Next to the Pahang, the Kelantan River is the largest on the east
coast. It is 120 miles long and is navigable for shallow-draft launches
and big country boats for about 80 miles, and for vessels of 8 ft.
draft for about six miles. Its principal tributaries are the Galas,
Pergau and Lebir. The Golok and Semarak rivers water the west
and east parts of the state, falling into the sea a few miles on either
side of the mouth of the Kelantan River. The climate of Kelantan
is mild and singularly healthy in the open cultivated regions. The
population is about 300,000 of which 10,000 are aboriginal tribes
(Sakeis and Jakuns), 10,000 Siamese and Chinese and the rest Malays.
The Chinese are increasing and natives of different parts of India
are resorting to the state for purposes of trade. Kota Bharu (pop.
10,000) is the only town in the state. It lies on the right bank of
the river, about six miles from the sea. Since 1904 it has been laid
out with metalled roads and many public and private buildings have
been erected. The town is the commercial as well as the administrative
centre of the state. Tumpat and Tabar on the coast, with
population 4000 and 3000 respectively, are the places next in importance
after Kota Bharu. A network of creeks render communication
easy in the northern districts, the river and its tributaries afford
means of access to all parts of the south; 20 miles of road have been
made in the neighbourhood of Kota Bharu. Kelantan is connected
by telegraph with Bangkok and Singapore, and maintains regular
postal communication with those places. Rice cultivation is the
principal industry and is increasing rapidly. Coco-nut and betel-nut
growing are also largely practised. Much livestock is raised. About
400,000 acres of land are under cultivation. Though reputed rich
in minerals, past misrule prevented mining enterprise in Kelantan
until, in 1900, a large concession was given to an Englishman and
the country was opened to foreigners. In 1909 three mining syndicates
were at work, and several others were in process of formation.
Gold, tin and galena have been found in several localities and during
the years 1906-1909 28,000 ounces of gold were dredged from the
Kelantan River. The Kelantanese are expert fishermen, some
30,000 finding employment in fishing and fish-drying. Silk-weaving
is a growing industry. Foreign trade, which in 1909 reached the
value of two and a half million dollars, is chiefly with Singapore.
Principal exports are copra, rice, fish, cattle and gold; chief imports
are cotton goods, hardware and specie. The currency is the Straits
Settlements dollar and small silver coin, supplemented by a locally
made tin coin of low value.</p>

<p>By virtue of a mutual agreement made in 1902 Siam appointed
a resident commissioner to Kelantan and consented, so long as the
advice of that officer should be followed, to leave internal affairs to
be conducted locally. Under this arrangement a council of state
was appointed, departments of government were organized, penal,
civil and revenue laws were passed and enforced, courts were established
and a police force was raised. Though formerly of an evil
reputation, the people were found to be naturally peaceful and law-abiding,
and serious crime is rare. The state revenue, which was
practically nothing in 1902, amounted to $320,000 in 1907. Islamism
was adopted about 300 years ago but the old animistic superstitions
are still strong. The state is divided into <i>mukim</i> or parishes,
but the <i>imam</i> no longer exercise temporal authority. There are
three schools at Kota Bharu, education in the interior being in the
hands of the imam assisted with government grants.</p>

<p>No historical records of Kelantan exist, and the state was not
noticed by the European merchants of the 16th and 17th centuries.
Consequently little is known of its early history beyond what is to
be gathered from brief references in the Malay annals and the old
chronicles of Siam. The sites of ancient towns and the remains of
former gold diggings are visible here and there, but all knowledge of
the men who made these marks has been lost. The present ruling
family dates from about 1790. Siam was frequently called upon to
maintain internal peace and in 1892 a royal prince was sent to reside
in Kelantan as commissioner. Complications brought about by the
incapacity of the ruler led to the making of the agreement of 1902
above mentioned, to the fixing of a regular tribute in money to Siam,
and ultimately to the merging of the state from chaotic lawlessness
into the path of reform. On the 15th of July 1909 the state came
under British suzerainty and the commissioner of Siam was replaced
by a British adviser, from which date the liability to payment of
tribute ceased, though in all other respects the administrative
arrangements of Siam remained unaltered.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sc">Trengganu.</span>&mdash;This state on the east coast, bounded N. and
N.E. by the China Sea, S. by Pahang and W. by Pahang and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page483" id="page483"></a>483</span>
Kelantan, lies between parallels 4° 4&prime; and 4° 46&prime; N. and 102° 30&prime;
and 103° 26&prime; E. The greatest length from north to south is
120 m., and the greatest breadth from east to west 50 m. It has
a coast-line of 130 m. and an estimated area of about 5000 sq. m.
There are several islands off the coast, some of which are
inhabited. The surface is generally mountainous.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Principal rivers are the Besut, Stiu, Trengganu, Dungun and
Kmamun, none of which is navigable for any distance. The climate
is mild and fairly healthy. The population numbers about 180,000,
almost all Malays, and mostly clusters round the mouths and lower
reaches of the rivers. The capital, which is situated at the mouth
of the Trengganu River, contains, with its suburbs, not less than
30,000 people. Difficulty of access by river and by land render the
interior districts almost uninhabitable. Communication is maintained
by boat along the coast. There are no roads and no postal
or telegraphic communications.</p>

<p>The majority of the people are sailors and fishermen. Rice is
grown, but not in sufficient quantities to supply local needs. Much
pepper and gambier were at one time grown and exported, but about
the year 1903 agriculture began to fall off owing to prevailing insecurity
of life and property. Not much livestock is raised, the few
head of cattle exported from Besut being mostly stolen from across
the neighbouring Kelantan border. A successful tin mine under
European control exists in the Kmamun district, but as everything
possible was done in the past to discourage all foreign enterprise, the
probable mineral wealth of the country is still practically untouched.
Silk-weaving, carried on entirely by the women, is a considerable
industry. The silk is imported raw and is re-exported in the form
of Malay clothing (<i>sarongs</i>) of patterns and quality which are widely
celebrated. The manufacture of native weapons and of brassware
was at one time brisk but is declining. The trade of Trengganu
is not increasing. It is valued roughly at about one and a half
million dollars a year, is chiefly with Singapore, and is to a great
extent carried in Trengganu-built ships, which latter also do some
carrying trade for other states on the east coast.</p>

<p>The Trengganu sultanate is one of the most ancient in the peninsula
and ranks with that of Riau. The state was feudatory to Malacca
in the 13th century and during the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries its
possession was frequently disputed between Malacca and Siam.
The present sultan is the descendant of an ancient family, the
members of which have quarrelled and fought with each other for
the succession from time immemorial. The last serious disturbance
was in 1837 when the grandfather of the present sultan stole the
throne from his nephew. Until the acquisition of the state by Great
Britain a triennial tribute of gold flowers was paid to Siam, and this
with occasional letters of instructions and advice, constituted almost
the only tangible evidence of Siamese suzerainty. Of government
there was practically none. The sultan, having alienated most of
his powers and prerogatives to his relatives, passed his life in religious
seclusion and was ruler in no more than name. The revenues were
devoured by the relatives, a small part of those accruing from the
capital sufficing for the sultan&rsquo;s needs. There were no written laws,
no courts and no police. All manner of crime was rampant, the
peasantry was mercilessly downtrodden, but the land was full of
holy men and the cries of the miserable were drowned in the noise of
ostentatious prayer. In fine, Trengganu presented in the beginning
of the year 1909 the type of untrammelled Malay rule which had
fortunately disappeared from every other state in the peninsula.
In July of that year, however, the first British adviser or agent
arrived in the state, which was shortly afterwards visited by the
governor of the Straits Settlements, who discussed with the sultan
the changed conditions consequent upon the Anglo-Siamese treaty
and laid the foundations of future reform.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sc">Kedah.</span>&mdash;This state, on the west coast of the peninsula, lies
between parallels 5° 20&prime; and 6° 42&prime; N., and is bounded, N. by
Palit and Songkla, E. by Songkla and Raman, S. by Province
Wellesley and Perak, and W. by the sea. The coast-line is 65 m.
long, the greatest distance from north to south is 115 m. and the
greatest breadth 46 m. Off the coast lies a group of islands, the
largest of which is Langkawi, well peopled and forming a district
of the state.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The total area of Kedah is about 4000 sq. m. The land is low-lying
and swampy near the coast except towards the south where
the height known as Kedah Hill rises from the shore opposite Penang,
flat and fertile farther inland, and mountainous towards the eastern
border. The rivers are small, the Sungei Kedah, navigable for a few
miles for vessels of 50 tons, and the S. Muda, which forms the boundary
with Province Wellesley, being the only streams worthy of notice.
The plains are formed of marine deposit, and in the mountains limestone
and granite preponderate. The population is estimated at
220,000, of whom about 100,000 are Malays, 50,000 Siamese and
Samsams and 70,000 Chinese and Madrassis (Klings). There are
three towns of importance. Alor Star, the capital, on the Kedah
river, 10 miles from the sea, in a flat, unhealthy, but fertile locality,
is a well laid out town with good streets, many handsome public and
private buildings, and good wharfage for small vessels. The population
is about 20,000, of whom more than half are Chinese and the
remainder government servants and retainers of the local aristocracy.
Kuala Muda (pop. 10,000) and Kulim (pop. 8000) situated in the
south, are unimposing collections of small birch houses and thatched
bamboo huts; the latter is the centre of the Kedah tin mining
industry. The bulk of the population is scattered over the plains
in small villages. A good road runs north from Alor Star to the
border of the state, a distance of 40 miles, and other roads are being
constructed. The state has 185 miles of telegraph line and 75 miles
of telephone line. Mails are closed daily at Alor Star for Penang
and there is a good internal postal service. The chief industry is
rice cultivation. Coco-nut, betel-nut and fruit plantations are
many, and the cultivation of rubber has recently been taken up with
prospects of success. The estimated area under cultivation is about
300,000 acres. There are rice-mills at Alor Star and at Kuala Muda.
The principal exports are rice, cattle and tin. The chief imports
are cotton goods, provisions, hardware and raw silk. Accurate
trade statistics are not available. The ruler holds the rank of
sultan and is assisted in the government by a council and by
the British adviser who since the state passed from Siamese
to British protection in 1909, has replaced the officer formerly
appointed by Siam. The sultan comes of a family long recognized
by Siam as having hereditary right to the rulership. The penal
and civil laws are administered in accordance with the precepts
of Islamism, the official religion of the state. Though much
has been done to improve the courts, justice is not easily obtainable.
A land registration system is in force but is in a state of
confusion, though a land law passed in 1905 gives security of
tenure over lands newly acquired. The mining laws are similar to
those of Siam. In 1905 the Siamese government advanced two and
a half million dollars to Kedah, to pay the debts of the state, which
sum was refunded by the British Government on assuming the position
of protector. The annual revenue is $1,000,000 and the expenditure
about the same. Chief heads of revenue are opium and
land tax. Many revenue monopolies, created in the past, have not
yet expired; but for this the revenue would be greater than it is.
There is no army. In 1906 the police service was reorganized under
British officers, resulting in great improvement to this department.
The state is divided into a number of administrative districts under
Malay officials. Each district comprises several <i>mukim</i> or parishes,
the <i>imam</i> of which exercise both spiritual and temporal control.
There are schools in the chief towns, but education has not yet been
seriously undertaken.</p>

<p>Kedah was founded by colonists from India in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1200, about
which time the Siamese had subdued Nakhon Sri Tammarat and
claimed the whole Malay Peninsula. When the rise of Malacca
shook Siamese authority in the peninsula, Kedah oscillated between
them, and on the conquest of Malacca by the Portuguese, fell to
Siam, though the capital was raided and burnt by the Europeans.
The ruler and his people were converted to Islam in the 15th century.
In 1768, the Siamese kingdom being disorganized, the sultan of
Kedah entered into direct political relations with the Hon. East
India Company, leasing the island of Penang to the latter. Further
treaties followed in 1791 and 1802, but in 1821 Siam reasserted her
control, expelling the rebellious sultan after a sanguinary war. The
sultan made several fruitless efforts to recover the state, and at
length made full submission, when he was reinstated. In 1868 an
agreement between Great Britain and Siam was substituted for the
treaties of the East India Company with the sultan. The present
sultan succeeded in 1881, and for 14 years governed well, but in
1895 he began to contract debts and to leave the government to his
minions. The result was chaos, and in 1905 the Siamese government
had to intervene to avert a condition of bankruptcy, adjusting the
finances and reorganizing the general administration to such effect
that when, four years later, the state became a British dependency,
a government was found established on a sound basis and requiring
nothing but the presence of a firm and experienced officer as adviser
to maintain its efficiency and assist its further advance.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sc">Perlis</span> (<i>Palit</i>).&mdash;This small state, consisting of the left bank
drainage area of the Perlis River, lies between Setul and Kedah,
which bound it on the N. and W. and on the E. respectively.
It touches the sea only round the mouth of the river.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The population is about 10,000, Malays and Chinese. The chief
town, Perlis, is situated about 12 m. up the river. A good deal of
tin is worked, and rice and pepper are grown and exported. In the
early part of the 19th century Perlis was a district of Kedah, but
during a period of disturbance in the latter state it established itself
as a separate chiefdom. In 1897 Siam restored the nominal authority
of Kedah, but the measure was not productive of good. In 1905 the
Siamese government advanced a loan of $200,000 to Perlis, and
appointed an English adviser to assist in the general administration.
This money was refunded to Siam and the adviser relieved by a
British officer when the state became British in July 1909. The
condition of the state has improved, but the revenue, $80,000, is
not sufficient for the immediate needs of government.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALAY STATES<a name="ar124" id="ar124"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Siamese</span>). The authority of Siam, which at
one time covered the whole of the Malay peninsula, now extends
southward to an irregular line drawn across the Peninsula at
about 6° 30&prime; N. Between that line and the Isthmus of Kra,
usually accepted as the northernmost point of the Malay Peninsula,
there lie some 20,000 sq. m. of territory inhabited by a
mixed population of Siamese and Malays with here and there
a few remnants of the aboriginal inhabitants clinging to the
wilder districts, and with a few Chinese settlers engaged in commerce.
Formerly this tract was divided into a number of states,
each of which was ruled by a chief (Siamese, <i>Chao Muang</i>;
Malay, <i>raja</i>), who held his title from the king of Siam, but,
subject to a few restrictions, conducted the affairs of his state
in accordance with his own desires; the office of chief, moreover,
was hereditary, subject always to the approval of the suzerain.
The states formed two groups: a northern, including Langsuan,
Chaya, Nakhon Sri Tammarat, Songkla, Renawng, Takoapa,
Pang Nga, Tongka and Trang, in which the Siamese element predominated
and of which the chiefs were usually Siamese or
Chinese; and a southern, including Palean, Satun (Setul),
Patani, Raman, Jering, Sai (Teloban), Re Nge (Legeh), Yala
(Jalor) and Nong Chik, in which the population was principally
Malay and the ruler also Malay. Four other states of the southern
group, Kelantan, Trengganu, Kedah and Perlis, of which the
population is entirely Malay, passed from Siamese to British
protection in 1909.</p>

<p>With the gradual consolidation of the Siamese kingdom all
the states of the northern group have been incorporated as
ordinary provinces of Siam (<i>q.v.</i>), the hereditary <i>Chao Muang</i>
having died or been pensioned and replaced by officials of the
Siamese Civil Service, while the states themselves now constitute
provinces of the administrative divisions of Chumpon,
Nakhon Sri Tammarat and Puket. The states of the southern
group, however, retain their hereditary rulers, each of whom
presides over a council and governs with the aid of a Siamese
assistant commissioner and with a staff of Siamese district
officials, subject to the general control of high commissioners
under whom the states are grouped. This southern group, with
a total area of about 7000 sq. m. and a population of 375,000,
constitutes the Siamese Malay States. A British consul with
headquarters at Puket, and a vice-consul who resides at Songkla,
watch over the interests of British subjects in the states of
the west and east sides of the peninsula respectively. Other
foreign powers are unrepresented.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Palean.</i>&mdash;This small state on the west coast, bounded N. by the
province of Trang, E. by the Songkla division, S. by the state of
Setul, and W. by the sea, is about 900 sq. m. in area, and has a
population of about 20,000. It is attached for administrative
purposes to the province of Trang, and its people are chiefly engaged
in the cultivation of pepper, of which about 150 tons are annually
exported. A few tin mines are also worked.</p>

<p><i>Satun</i> (<i>Setul</i>).&mdash;This small state, bounded N. by Palean, E. by
Songkla, S. by Perlis, and W. by the sea, contains about 1000 sq. m.
area with a population of about 25,000, Malays, Siamese and a few
Chinese. The principal production is pepper, which is exported in
junks and in the small Penang steamers which ply on the west coast
of the peninsula. In 1897 Setul was placed under the control of
Kedah, then a Siamese dependency, but the arrangement was not
a success, and in 1907 the Siamese government was forced, owing to
prevailing corruption and misrule, to restrict the powers of the chief
and, cancelling the authority of Kedah, to place him to some extent
under the orders of the high commissioner of Songkla. By the terms
of the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909 about half of the state of Perlis
was added to Satun, an arrangement by which the importance of the
latter was considerably increased.</p>

<p><i>Patani.</i>&mdash;The seven Malay states of Nawng Chik, Patani, Jering,
Yala (Jalor), Sai (Teloban), Raman and Ra-ngé (Legeh) were constituted
from the old state of Patani at the beginning of the 19th
century. In 1906 they were reunited to form the Patani administrative
division of Siam, but each state retains its Malay ruler, who
governs jointly with a Siamese officer under the direction of the
Siamese high commissioner, and many of the ancient privileges
and customs of Malay government are preserved. The group of
States is situated between 5° 34&prime; and 6° 52&prime; N. and 100° 54&prime; and 101°
58&prime; E. It is bounded N. by the China Sea, E. by the China Sea and
Kelantan, S. by Perak, and W. by Kedah. The total area is about
5000 sq. m. The country is mountainous except close to the coast.
The principal rivers are the Patani and <span class="correction" title="amended from tle">the</span> Teloban, long, winding
and shallow, and navigable for small boats only. The population
is about 335,000, of whom the great majority are Malays. Each
state has its capital, but Patani (the headquarters of the high commissioner)
is the only town of importance. Communications are
poor and are chiefly by river, but roads are under construction.
Patani and Sai are in telegraphic communication with Bangkok and
Singapore, and regular weekly mails are despatched to those places.
The area under cultivation is small except round about Patani and
in Nawng Chik, where much rice is grown. Tin mining is a growing
industry; many Chinese own mines and several European syndicates
are at work in Raman, Ra-ngé and Patani, prospecting for, or mining,
this metal. Fishing and salt-evaporation occupy a large proportion
of the population. The annual export of tin is about 400 tons, and
dried fish, salt, cattle and elephants are other exports. Steamers
up to 300 tons maintain frequent communication with Bangkok and
Singapore, and the Patani roads afford good anchorage at all seasons.</p>

<p>Mahommedan law is followed in the settlement of inherited
property disputes and of matrimonial affairs; otherwise the laws of
Siam obtain. Efficient law courts have been established in each
state, and there is a serviceable force of gendarmerie recruited from
amongst Malays and Siamese alike. The revenue amounts to about
600,000 ticals, or £45,000 a year, one-third being payable to the rulers
as private income for themselves and their relatives, one-third
expended on the administration, and one-third reserved for special
purposes, but it is usually found necessary to devote the last-mentioned
third to the expenses of administration. Patani has
been subject to Siam from the remotest times. It is said that the old
state adopted Islamism in the 16th century, the chief, a relative of the
kings of Siam, embracing that religion and at the same time revolting
to Malacca. It has several times been necessary to send punitive
expeditions to recall the state to its allegiance. The present rulers
are mostly descended from the ruling families of the neighbouring
state of Kelantan, but the chief of Patani itself is a member of the
family which ruled there in the days of its greatness. Throughout
the 17th century Patani was resorted to by Portuguese, Dutch and
English merchants, who had factories ashore and used the place as
an emporium for trade with Siam. In 1621 an engagement took
place in the Patani roads between three Dutch and two British ships,
the latter being taken after the president of the British merchants,
John Jourdain, had been killed. In 1899 the border between the
state of Perak and Raman was fixed by an agreement between
England and Siam, a dispute of old standing being thereby settled,
but the question was reopened in the negotiations which preceded
the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909, when a new border line was fixed
between British and Siamese possessions in the Peninsula.</p>

<span class="sc">Malcolm I</span>., king from 943 to 954, and <span class="sc">Malcolm II</span>., king from 1005
to 1034, are shadowy and unimportant personages.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Malcolm III</span>. (d. 1093), called Canmore or the &ldquo;large-headed,&rdquo;
was a son of King Duncan I., and became king after
the defeat of the usurper Macbeth in July 1054, being crowned
at Scone in April 1057. Having married as his second wife,
(St) Margaret (<i>q.v.</i>), a sister of Edgar Ætheling, who was a fugitive
at his court, he invaded England in 1070 to support the claim of
Edgar to the English throne, returning to Scotland with many
captives after harrying Northumbria. William the Conqueror
answered this attack by marching into Scotland in 1072, whereupon
Malcolm made peace with the English king at Abernethy
and &ldquo;was his man.&rdquo; However, in spite of this promise he
ravaged the north of England again and again, until in 1091
William Rufus invaded Scotland and received his submission.
Then in 1092 a fresh dispute arose between the two kings, and
William summoned Malcolm to his court at Gloucester. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page485" id="page485"></a>485</span>
Scot obeyed, and calling at Durham on his southward journey
was present at the foundation of Durham Cathedral. When he
reached Gloucester Rufus refused to receive him unless he did
homage for his kingdom; he declined and returned home in
high dudgeon. Almost at once he invaded Northumbria, and
was killed at a place afterwards called Malcolm&rsquo;s Cross, near
Alnwick, on the 13th of November 1093. Four of Malcolm&rsquo;s
sons, Duncan II., Edgar, Alexander I., and David I., became
kings of Scotland; and one of his daughters, Matilda, became
the wife of Henry I. of England, a marriage which united the
Saxon and the Norman royal houses.</p>

the &ldquo;Maiden,&rdquo; and died unmarried on the 9th of December
1165.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALCOLM, SIR JOHN<a name="ar127" id="ar127"></a></span> (1769-1833), Anglo-Indian soldier,
diplomatist, administrator and author, was born at Burnfoot on
the Esk, near Langholm, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, on the 2nd
of May 1769. His father was a humble farmer, but three of
his sons attained the honour of knighthood. At the age of
twelve he received a cadetship in the Indian army, and in April
1783 he landed at Madras, shortly afterwards joining his regiment
at Vellore. In 1792, having for some time devoted himself
to the study of Persian, he was appointed to the staff of Lord
Cornwallis as Persian interpreter, but two years afterwards was
compelled by ill health to leave for England. On his return to
India in 1796 he became military secretary to Sir Alured Clarke,
commander-in-chief at Madras, and afterwards to his successor
General Harris; and in 1798 he was appointed by Lord Wellesley
assistant to the resident at Hyderabad. In the last-mentioned
capacity he highly distinguished himself by the manner in which
he gave effect to the difficult measure of disbanding the French
corps in the pay of the nizam. In 1799, under the walls of
Seringapatam, began his intimacy with Colonel Arthur Wellesley,
which in a short time ripened into a lifelong friendship. In the
course of the same year he acted as first secretary to the commission
appointed to settle the Mysore government, and before its
close he was appointed by Lord Wellesley to proceed as envoy
to the court of Persia for the purpose of counteracting the policy
of the French by inducing that country to form a British alliance.
Arriving at Teheran in December 1800, he was successful in
negotiating favourable treaties, both political and commercial,
and returned to Bombay by way of Bagdad in May 1801. He
now for some time held the interim post of private secretary
to Lord Wellesley, and in 1803 was appointed to the Mysore
residency. At the close of the Mahratta War, in 1804, and again
in 1805, he negotiated important treaties with Sindhia and
Holkar, and in 1806, besides seeing the arrangements arising out
of these alliances carried out, he directed the difficult work of
reducing the immense body of irregular native troops. In 1808
he was again sent on a mission to Persia, but circumstances
prevented him from getting beyond Bushire; on his reappointment
in 1810, he was successful indeed in procuring a favourable
reception at court, but otherwise his embassy, if the information
which he afterwards incorporated in his works on Persia be left
out of account, was (through no fault of his) without any substantial
result. He sailed for England in 1811, and shortly after
his arrival in the following year was knighted. His intervals
of leisure he devoted to literary work, and especially to the composition
of a <i>History of Persia</i>, which was published in two
quarto volumes in 1815. On his return to India in 1817 he was
appointed by Lord Moira his political agent in the Deccan,
with eligibility for military command; as brigadier-general
under Sir T. Hislop he took a distinguished part in the victory
of Mehidpur (December 21, 1817), as also in the subsequent
work of following up the fugitives, determining the conditions
of peace and settling the country. In 1821 he returned once
more to England, where he remained until 1827, when he was
appointed governor of Bombay. His influence in this office was
directed to the promotion of various economical reforms and useful
administrative measures. Leaving India for the last time
in 1830, he shortly after his arrival in England entered parliament
as member for Launceston, and was an active opponent of the
Reform Bill. He died of paralysis on the 30th of May 1833.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALDA<a name="ar128" id="ar128"></a></span>, a district of British India, in the Rajshahi division of
Eastern Bengal and Assam. Area, 1899 sq. m.; pop. (1901),
884,030, showing an increase of 8.5 in the decade. The administrative
headquarters are at English Bazar (pop. 13,667) near the
town of Old Malda. The district is divided into two almost
equal parts by the Mahananda river, flowing from north to south.
The western tract between the Mahananda and the main stream
of the Ganges is an alluvial plain of sandy soil and great fertility.
The eastern half is an elevated region broken by the deep valleys
of the Tangan and Purnabhaba rivers and their small tributary
streams. The soil here is a hard red clay; and the whole is
overgrown with thorny tree jungle known as the <i>k&#257;t&#257;l</i>. Agricultural
prosperity centres on the Mahananda, where mango
orchards and high raised plots of mulberry land extend continuously
along both banks of the river. The Ganges nowhere
intersects the district, but skirts it from its north-western corner
to the extreme south. The Mahananda flows in a deep well-defined
channel through the centre, and joins the Ganges at the
southern corner. Its tributaries are the Kalindri on the right,
and the Tangan and Purnabhaba on the left bank. The two
principal industries are the production of indigo and silk. The
first has declined, and so has the second as far as concerns the
weaving of piece goods, but the rearing of silkworms and the
export of raw silk and silk thread are carried on upon a large
scale. No railway touches the district, but the communications
by water are good.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Malda supplied two great capitals to the early Mahommedan kings
of Bengal; and the sites of Gaur and Pandua exhibit the most interesting
remains to be found in the lower valley of the Ganges. (See
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gaur</a></span>.) The connexion of the East India Company with Malda dates
from a very early period. As far back as 1676 there was a factory
there. In 1770 English Bazar was fixed upon for a commercial
residency, the buildings of which at the present day form both the
public offices and private residence of the collector.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALDEN<a name="ar129" id="ar129"></a></span>, a city, including several villages, of Middlesex
county, Massachusetts, U.S.A., on the Malden river, about
5 m. N. of Boston. Pop. (1890), 23,031, (1900), 33,664, of whom
9513 were foreign-born, 3673 being English Canadians, 870
English, and 617 Swedes; (1910 census) 44,404. Malden
had in 1906 a land area of 4.78 sq. m. It is served by the
Boston &amp; Maine railroad, and by inter-urban electric railways.
Although it is largely a residential suburb of Boston&mdash;its post
office is a Boston sub-station&mdash;it has important manufacturing
industries. The most valuable manufactured product is rubber
boots and shoes. The capital invested in manufacturing in
1905 was $5,553,432; and the value of the factory product,
$11,235,635, was 70.2% greater than the value of the factory
product in 1900. Among Malden&rsquo;s institutions are the public
library (endowed by Elisha S. Converse), the Malden hospital,
the Malden day nursery, a Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Association,
and a home for the aged. A fine system of parks is maintained;
the best known is possibly Pine Banks. To the north and west is
the Middlesex Fells, a state reservation; about 60 acres of this
and about 20 acres of the Middlesex Fells Parkway lie within
Malden. Malden, when first settled about 1640, was part of
Charlestown, and was known for some years as Mystic Side.
It was incorporated as a town under the name of &ldquo;Mauldon&rdquo;
in 1640, and was chartered as a city in 1881. The north part of
Malden was set off in 1850 to form Melrose, and the south part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page486" id="page486"></a>486</span>
in 1870 to form the town of Everett. Malden was the birthplace
of Adoniram Judson, the &ldquo;apostle to Burma.&rdquo; Michael
Wigglesworth was pastor here from 1656 until 1705.</p>

It consists of seventeen atolls with an immense number of
islands, of which some three hundred are inhabited. In the
extreme south are the isolated atolls of Addu and Fua-Mulaku,
separated from Suvadiva by the Equatorial Channel, which is
itself separated from the main chain of atolls by One-and-a-half-degree
Channel.<a name="fa1m" id="fa1m" href="#ft1m"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Following the chain northward from
this channel, we have Haddumati and Kolumadulu, after which
the chain becomes double: to the east the chief atolls are
Mulaku, Felidu, South Malé, North Malé, Kardiva (where the
channel of the same name, 35 m. broad, partly breaks the chain),
and Fadiffolu. To the west are South Nilandu, North Nilandu,
Ari, South Mahlos, North Mahlos and Miladumadulu. To the
north again are Tiladumati and Ihavandifulu. Finally, to the
north of Eight-degree Channel is Minikoi, 71 m. from the nearest
point of the Maldives, and 110 m. from that of the Laccadives to
the north. The main part of the archipelago, north of One-and-a-half-degree
Channel, consists of a series of banks either surrounded
or studded all over with reefs (see J. S. Gardiner, &ldquo;Formation
of the Maldives,&rdquo; in <i>Geographical Journ.</i> xix. 277 seq.).
Mr Gardiner regarded these banks as plateaus rising to different
elevations beneath the surface of the sea from a main plateau
rising steeply from the great depths of the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>After the Portuguese, from about 1518 onwards, had attempted
many times to establish themselves on the islands by
force, and after the Maldivians had endured frequent raids by
the Mopla pirates of the Malabar coast, they began to send tokens
of homage and claims of protection (the first recorded being in
1645) to the rulers of Ceylon, and their association with this
island has continued practically ever since. The hereditary
sultan of the archipelago is tributary to the British government
of Ceylon. The population of the Maldives is estimated at
30,000. All are Mahommedans. By Messrs. Gardiner and
Cooper they are classed in four ethnological divisions. (1)
Those of the atolls north of the Kardiva Channel. Here the
reefs are generally less perfect than elsewhere, seldom forming
complete central lagoons, and as they were formerly exposed
to the constant attacks of the Mopla pirates from India, the
people are hardier and more vigorous than their less warlike
southern neighbours. They annually visited the coasts of
India or Ceylon, and often married Indian wives, thus acquiring
distinct racial characters of an approximately Dravidian type.
(2) Those of the central division, comprising the atolls between
North Malé and Haddumati, who are under the direct rule of
the sultan, and have been more exposed to Arab influences.
They formerly traded with Arabia and Malaysia, and many
Arabs settled amongst them, so that they betray a strong strain
of Semitic blood in their features. (3 and 4) The natives of
Suvadiva, Addu, Mulaku and the other southern clusters, who
have had little communication with the Central Malé people,
and probably preserve more of the primitive type, approximating
in appearance to the Sinhalese villagers of Ceylon. They
are an intelligent and industrious people, growing their own
crops, manufacturing their own cloth and mats, and building
their own boats, while many read Arabic more or less fluently,
although still believers in magic and witchcraft. The language
is a dialect of Sinhalese, but indicating a separation of ancient
date and more or less mahommedanized.</p>

<p>The sultan&rsquo;s residence and the capital of the archipelago is
the island of Malé. From the earliest notices the production
of coir, the collection of cowries, and the weaving of excellent
textures on these islands have been noted. The chief exports
of the islands besides coir and cowries (a decreasing trade) are
coco-nuts, copra, tortoise-shell and dried bonito-fish.</p>

<p>Minikoi atoll, with the numerous wrecks on its reefs, its lighthouse,
and its position on the track of all eastward-bound
vessels, is a familiar sight to seafarers in these waters. The
atoll, which is pear-shaped and disposed in the direction from
S.W. to N.E. is 5 m. long, with an extreme breadth of nearly
3 m., with a large but shallow lagoon approached from the
north by a passage two fathoms deep. The atoll is growing outwards
on every side, and at one place rises 19 ft. above sea-level.
The population, which numbers about 3000, is sharply divided
into five castes, of which the three highest are pure Maldivians,
the lower two the same as in the Laccadives. All are centred
in a small village opposite Mou Rambu Point on the west or
lagoon side; but most of the men are generally absent, many
being employed with the Lascar crews on board the large liners
plying in the eastern seas.</p>

the Maldon parliamentary borough of Essex, England, on an
acclivity rising from the south side of the Blackwater, 43 m.
E.N.E. from London by a branch from Witham of the Great
Eastern railway. Pop. (1901), 5565. There are east and west
railway stations. The church of All Saints, dating from 1056,
but, as it stands, Early English and later, consists of chancel,
nave and aisles, with a triangular Early English tower (a unique
form) at the west end surmounted by a hexagonal spire. The
tower of St Mary&rsquo;s Church shows Norman work with Roman
materials. The other public buildings are the grammar school,
founded in 1547; the town-hall, formerly D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s tower, built
in the reign of Henry VI.; and the public hall. There are manufactures
of crystallized salt, breweries, an oyster fishery and some
shipping. On Osea Island, in the Blackwater estuary, there is a
farm colony for the unemployed. A mile west of Maldon are remains
of Beeleigh Abbey, a Premonstratensian foundation of
the 12th century. They consist of the chapter-house and
another chamber, and are of fine Early English work. The
borough is under a mayor, 4 aldermen and 12 councillors.
Area, 3028 acres.</p>

<p>At Maldon (<i>Maelduna</i>, <i>Melduna</i>, <i>Mealdon</i> or <i>Meaudon</i>)
palaeolithic, neolithic and Roman remains that have been found
seem to indicate an early settlement. It is not, however, an
important Roman site. An earthwork, of which traces exist,
may be Saxon or Danish. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle relates
that Edward the Elder established a &ldquo;burh&rdquo; there about 921,
and that Ealdorman Brihtnoth was killed there by the Danes in
991. The position of Maldon may have given it some commercial
importance, but the fortress is the point emphasized by
the Chronicle. Maldon remained a royal town up to the reign
of Henry I., and thus is entered as on <i>terra regis</i> in Domesday.
Henry II. granted the burgesses their first charter, probably in
1155, giving them the land of the borough and suburb with sac
and soc and other judicial rights, also freedom from county
and forest jurisdiction, danegeld, scutage, tallage and all tolls,
by the service of one ship a year for forty days. This charter
was confirmed by Edward I. in 1290, by Edward III. in 1344,
and by Richard II. in 1378. In 1403 the bishop of London
granted further judicial and financial rights, and Henry V. confirmed
the charters in 1417, Henry VI. in 1443, and Henry VIII.
in 1525. Maldon was incorporated by Philip and Mary in 1554,
and received confirmatory charters from Elizabeth in 1563 and
1592, from Charles I. in 1631, Charles II. and James II. In
1768 the incorporation charter was regranted, with modifications
in 1810.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page487" id="page487"></a>487</span>
Malebranche, secretary to Louis XIII., and Catherine de Lauzon,
sister of a viceroy of Canada, was born at Paris on the 6th of
August 1638. Deformed and constitutionally feeble, he received
his elementary education from a tutor, and left home only when
sufficiently advanced to enter upon a course of philosophy at
the Collège de la Marche, and subsequently to study theology
at the Sorbonne. He had resolved to take holy orders, but
his studious disposition led him to decline a stall in Notre Dame,
and in 1660 he joined the congregation of the Oratory. He
was first advised by Père Lecointe to devote himself to ecclesiastical
history, and laboriously studied Eusebius, Socrates, Sozomen
and Theodoret, but &ldquo;the facts refused to arrange themselves
in his mind, and mutually effaced one another.&rdquo; Richard
Simon undertook to teach him Hebrew and Biblical criticism
with no better success. At last in 1664 he chanced to read
Descartes&rsquo;s <i>Traité de l&rsquo;homme</i> (<i>de homine</i>), which moved him so
deeply that (it is said) he was repeatedly compelled by palpitations
of the heart to lay aside his reading. Malebranche was
from that hour consecrated to philosophy, and after ten years&rsquo;
study of the works of Descartes he produced the famous <i>De la
recherche de la vérité</i>, followed at intervals by other works, both
speculative and controversial. Like most of the great metaphysicians
of the 17th century, Malebranche interested himself
also in questions of mathematics and natural philosophy, and
in 1699 was admitted an honorary member of the Academy of
Sciences. During his later years his society was much courted,
and he received many visits from foreigners of distinction. He
died on the 13th of October 1715; his end was said to have been
hastened by a metaphysical argument into which he had been
drawn in the course of an interview with Bishop Berkeley. For
a critical account of Malebranche&rsquo;s place in the history of
philosophy, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cartesianism</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALER KOTLA,<a name="ar133" id="ar133"></a></span> a native state of India, within the Punjab.
It ranks as one of the Cis-Sutlej states, which came under British
influence in 1809. The territory lies south of Ludhiana. Area,
167 sq. m. Pop. (1901), 77,506, showing an increase of 2% in
the decade. Estimated gross revenue, £30,100. The military
force numbers 280 men; and there is no tribute. The town
Maler Kotla is 30 m. S. of Ludhiana; pop. (1901), 21,122. The
nawab or chief is of Afghan descent; his family originally came
from Kabul, and occupied positions of trust in Sirhind under the
Mogul emperors. They gradually became independent as the
Mogul Empire sank into decay in the course of the 18th century.
In General Lake&rsquo;s campaign against Holkar in 1805 the nawab
of Maler Kotla sided with the British. After the subjugation
and flight of Holkar, the English government succeeded to the
power of the Mahrattas in the districts between the Sutlej and
the Jumna; and in 1809 its protection was formally extended to
Maler Kotla, as to the other Cis-Sutlej states, against the formidable
encroachments of Ranjit Singh. In the campaigns
of 1806, 1807 and 1808 Ranjit Singh had made considerable
conquests across the Sutlej; in 1808 he marched on Maler Kotla
and demanded a ransom of £10,000 from the nawab. This led
to the interference of the British, who addressed an ultimatum
to Ranjit Singh, declaring the Cis-Sutlej states to be under
British protection. Finally the raja of Lahore submitted, and
the nawab was reinstated in February 1809. Owing to the
mental incapacity of nawab Ibrahim Ali Khan, the state was
administered in recent years for some time by the chief of
Loharu; but his son, Ahmed Ali Khan, was made regent in
February 1905.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALESHERBES, CHRÉTIEN GUILLAUME DE LAMOIGNON DE<a name="ar134" id="ar134"></a></span>
(1721-1794), commonly known as Lamoignon-Malesherbes,
French statesman, minister, and afterwards counsel for the
defence of Louis XVI., came of a famous legal family. He was
born at Paris on the 6th of December 1721, and was educated for
the legal profession. The young lawyer soon proved his intellectual
capacity, when he was appointed president of the <i>cour des
aides</i> in the parlement of Paris in 1750 on the promotion of his
father, Guillaume de Lamoignon, to be chancellor. One of the
chancellor&rsquo;s duties was to control the press, and this duty was
entrusted to Malesherbes by his father during his eighteen years
of office, and brought him into connexion with the public far
more than his judicial functions. To carry it out efficiently
he kept in communication with the literary leaders of Paris,
and especially with Diderot, and Grimm even goes so far as to
say that &ldquo;without the assistance of Malesherbes the <i>Encyclopédie</i>
would probably never have been published.&rdquo; In 1771 he was
called upon to mix in politics; the parlements of France had
been dissolved, and a new method of administering justice
devised by Maupeou, which was in itself commendable as tending
to the better and quicker administration of justice, but pernicious
as exhibiting a tendency to over-centralization, and as abolishing
the hereditary &ldquo;nobility of the robe,&rdquo; which, with all its faults,
had from its nature preserved some independence, and been a
check on the royal power. Malesherbes presented a strong
remonstrance against the new system, and was at once banished
to his country seat at St Lucie, to be recalled, however, with the
old parlement on the accession of Louis XVI., and to be made
minister of the <i>maison du roi</i> in 1775. He only held office nine
months, during which, however, he directed his attention to the
police of the kingdom, which came under his department, and
did much to check the odious practice of issuing <i>lettres de cachet</i>.
The protest of the <i>cour des aides</i> in 1775 is one of the most
important documents of the old régime in France. It gives a
complete survey of the corrupt and inefficient administration,
and presented the king with most outspoken criticism. On
retiring from the ministry with Turgot in 1776, he betook himself
entirely to a happy country and domestic life and travelled
through Switzerland, Germany and Holland. An essay on
Protestant marriages (1787) did much to procure for them the
civil recognition in France. He had always been an enthusiastic
botanist; his avenue at St Lucie was world famous; he had
written against Buffon on behalf of the botanists whom Buffon
had attacked, and had been elected a member of the <i>Académie
des sciences</i> as far back as 1750. He was now elected a member
of the <i>Académie française</i>, and everything seemed to promise a
quiet and peaceful old age spent in the bosom of his family and
occupied with scientific and literary pursuits, when the king in
his difficulties wished for the support of his name, and summoned
him back to the ministry in 1787. Lamoignon-Malesherbes
held office but a short time, but returned to his country life this
time with a feeling of insecurity and disquiet, and, as the troubles
increased, retired to Switzerland. Nevertheless, in December
1792, in spite of the fair excuse his old age and long retirement
would have given him, he voluntarily left his asylum and undertook
with Tronchet and Desèze the defence of the king before
the Convention, and it was his painful task to break the news of
his condemnation to the king. After this effort he returned once
more to the country, but in December 1793 he was arrested with
his daughter, his son-in-law M. de Rosambo, and his grandchildren,
and on the 23rd of April 1794 he was guillotined, after
having seen all whom he loved in the world executed before his
eyes for their relationship to him. Malesherbes is one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page488" id="page488"></a>488</span>
sweetest characters of the 18th century; though no man of
action, hardly a man of the world, by his charity and unfeigned
goodness he became one of the most popular men in France, and
it was an act of truest self-devotion in him to sacrifice himself for
a king who had done little or nothing for him.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>There are in print several scientific works of Malesherbes of varying
value, of which the most interesting is his <i>Observations sur Buffon
et Daubenton</i>, written when he was very young, and published with
a notice by Abeille in 1798. There exist also his <i>Mémoire pour
Louis XVI.</i>, his <i>Mémoire sur la liberté de la presse</i> (published 1809)
and extracts from his remonstrances, published as <i>&OElig;uvres choisies
de Malesherbes</i> in 1809. For his life should be read the <i>Notice
historique</i> (3rd ed., 1806) of Dubois, the <i>Éloge historique</i> (1805) of
Gaillard, and the interesting <i>Essai sur la vie, les écrits et les opinions de
M. de Malesherbes</i> (in 2 vols., 1818), of F. A. de Boissy d&rsquo;Anglas. There
are also many éloges on him in print, of which the best-known is that
of M. Dupin, which was delivered at the Academy in 1841, and was
reviewed with much light on Malesherbes&rsquo;s control of the press by
Sainte-Beuve in the 2nd volume of the <i>Causeries du lundi</i>. The
protest of the <i>cour des aides</i> has been published with translation
by G. Robinson in the <i>Translations and Reprints of the University
of Pennsylvania</i> (1900). For his defence of Louis XVI. see Marquis
de Beaucourt, <i>Captivité et derniers moments de Louis XVI.</i> (2 vols.,

<p><span class="bold">MALHERBE, FRANÇOIS DE<a name="ar136" id="ar136"></a></span> (1555-1628), French poet,
critic and translator, was born at Caen in 1555. His family
was of some position, though it seems not to have been able to
establish to the satisfaction of heralds the claims which it made
to nobility older than the 16th century. The poet was the
eldest son of another François de Malherbe, <i>conseiller du roi</i>
in the magistracy of Caen. He himself was elaborately educated
at Caen, at Paris, at Heidelberg and at Basel. At the age of
twenty-one, preferring arms to the gown, he entered the household
of Henri d&rsquo;Angoulême, grand prior of France, the natural
son of Henry II. He served this prince as secretary in Provence,
and married there in 1581. It seems that he wrote verses at
this period, but, to judge from a quotation of Tallemant des
Réaux, they must have been very bad ones. His patron died
when Malherbe was on a visit in his native province, and for a
time he had no particular employment, though by some servile
verses he obtained a considerable gift of money from Henry III.,
whom he afterwards libelled. He lived partly in Provence and
partly in Normandy for many years after this event; but very
little is known of his life during this period. His <i>Larmes de
Saint Pierre</i>, imitated from Luigi Tansillo, appeared in 1587.</p>

<p>It was in the year parting the two centuries (1600) that he
presented to Marie de&rsquo; Medici an ode of welcome, the first of
his remarkable poems. But four or five years more passed
before his fortune, which had hitherto been indifferent, turned.
He was presented by his countryman, the Cardinal Du Perron,
to Henry IV.; and, though that economical prince did not at
first show any great eagerness to entertain the poet, he was at
last summoned to court and endowed after one fashion or
another. It is said that the pension promised him was not
paid till the next reign. His father died in 1606, and he came
into his inheritance. From this time forward he lived at court,
corresponding affectionately with his wife, but seeing her only
twice in some twenty years. His old age was saddened by a
great misfortune. His son, Marc Antoine, a young man of
promise, fell in a duel in 1626. His father used his utmost
influence to have the guilty parties (for more than one were
concerned, and there are grounds for thinking that it was not
a fair duel) brought to justice. But he died before the suit
was decided (it is said in consequence of disease caught at the
camp of La Rochelle, whither he had gone to petition the king),
in Paris, on the 16th of October, 1628, at the age of seventy-three.</p>

<p>The personal character of Malherbe was far from amiable,
but he exercised, or at least indicated the exercise of, a great
and enduring effect upon French literature, though by no means
a wholly beneficial one. The lines of Boileau beginning <i>Enfin
Malherbe vint</i> are rendered only partially applicable by the
extraordinary ignorance of older French poetry which distinguished
that peremptory critic. But the good as well as bad
side of Malherbe&rsquo;s theory and practice is excellently described
by his contemporary and superior Regnier, who was animated
against him, not merely by reason of his own devotion to Ronsard
but because of Malherbe&rsquo;s discourtesy towards Regnier&rsquo;s uncle
P. Desportes, whom the Norman poet had at first distinctly
copied. These are the lines:&mdash;</p>

</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">This is perfectly true, and from the time of Malherbe dates that
great and deplorable falling off of French poetry in its more
poetic qualities, which was not made good till 1830. Nevertheless
the critical and restraining tendency of Malherbe was
not ill in place after the luxuriant importation and innovation
of the <i>Pléiade</i>; and if he had confined himself to preaching
greater technical perfection, and especially greater simplicity
and purity in vocabulary and versification, instead of superciliously
striking his pen through the great works of his predecessors,
he would have deserved wholly well. As it was, his
reforms helped to elaborate the kind of verse necessary for the
classical tragedy, and that is the most that can be said for him.
His own poetical work is scanty in amount, and for the most
part frigid and devoid of inspiration. The beautiful <i>Consolation
à Duperier</i>, in which occurs the famous line&mdash;</p>

<p class="center f90">Et, rose, elle a vécu ce que vivent les roses&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">the odes to Marie de&rsquo; Medici and to Louis XIII., and a few other
pieces comprise all that is really worth remembering of him.
His prose work is much more abundant, not less remarkable
for care as to style and expression, and of greater positive value.
It consists of some translations of Livy and Seneca, and of a
very large number of interesting and admirably written letters,
many of which are addressed to Peiresc, the man of science of
whom Gassendi has left a delightful Latin life. It contains also
a most curious commentary on Desportes, in which Malherbe&rsquo;s
minute and carping style of verbal criticism is displayed on the
great scale.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The chief authorities for the biography of Malherbe are the <i>Vie de
Malherbe</i> by his friend and pupil Racan, and the long <i>Historiette</i>
which Tallemant des Réaux has devoted to him. The standard
edition is the admirable one of Ludovic Lalanne (5 vols., Paris,
1862-1869). Of the poems only, there is an excellent and handsome
little issue in the <i>Nouvelle collection Jannet</i> (Paris, 1874). Of modern
works devoted to him, <i>La Doctrine de Malherbe</i>, by G. Brunot (1891),
is not only the most important but a work altogether capital in
regard to the study of French language and literature. Others are
A. Gasté, <i>La Jeunesse de Malherbe</i> (1890); V. Bourrienne, <i>Points
obscurs dans la vie normande de Malherbe</i> (1895); and the duc de
Broglie&rsquo;s &ldquo;Malherbe&rdquo; in <i>Les Grands écrivains français</i>. On his
position in French and general critical history, G. Saintsbury&rsquo;s

<p><span class="bold">MALIBRAN, MARIE FÉLICITÉ<a name="ar137" id="ar137"></a></span> (1808-1836), operatic singer,
daughter of Manoel Garcia, was born in Paris on the 24th of
March 1808. Her father was then a member of the company of
the Théâtre des Italiens, and she accompanied him to Italy and
London. She possessed a soprano voice of unusual beauty and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page489" id="page489"></a>489</span>
phenomenal compass, which was carefully cultivated by her
father. She was only seventeen when, in consequence of an
indisposition of Madame Pasta, she was suddenly asked to take
her place in <i>The Barber of Seville</i> at Covent Garden. She was
forthwith engaged for the remaining six weeks of the season,
and then followed her father to New York, where she appeared
in <i>Othello</i>, <i>The Barber of Seville</i>, <i>Don Juan</i>, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>,
<i>Tancred</i>. Her gifts as an actress were on a par with her magnificent
voice, and her gaiety made her irresistible in light opera,
although her great triumphs were obtained chiefly in tragic
parts. She married a French banker of New York, named
Malibran, who was much older than herself. The marriage was
an unhappy one, and Mme Malibran returned alone to Europe
in 1828, when she began the series of representations at the
Théâtre des Italiens, which excited an enthusiasm in Paris only
exceeded by the reception she received in the principal towns
of Italy. She was formally divorced from Malibran in 1835,
and married the Belgian violinist, Charles de Beriot; but she
died of fever on the 23rd of September 1836.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALIC ACID<a name="ar138" id="ar138"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Hydroxyethylene Succinic Acid</span>), C<span class="su">4</span>H<span class="su">6</span>O<span class="su">5</span>,
an organic acid found abundantly in the juices of many plants,
particularly in mountain-ash berries, in unripe apples and in
grapes. The acid potassium salt is also found in the leaves
and stalks of rhubarb. Since the acid contains an asymmetric
carbon atom, it can exist in three forms, a dextro-rotatory, a
laevo-rotatory and an inactive form; the acid obtained in the
various synthetical processes is the inactive form. It may be
prepared by heating racemic acid (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tartaric Acid</a></span>) with
fuming hydriodic acid; by heating fumaric acid (<i>q.v.</i>) with water
at 150-200° C.; by the action of nitrous acid on inactive aspartic
acid; and by the action of moist silver oxide on monobromsuccinic
acid. It forms deliquescent crystals, which are readily
soluble in alcohol and melt at 100° C. When heated for some
time at 130° C. it yields fumaric acid (<i>q.v.</i>), and on rapid heating
at 180° C. gives maleic anhydride and fumaric acid. It yields
coumarins when warmed with sulphuric acid and phenols (H.
v. Pechmann, <i>Ber.</i>, 1884, 17, 929, 1649 et seq.). Potassium
bichromate oxidizes it to malonic acid; nitric acid oxidizes it
to oxalic acid; and hydriodic acid reduces it to succinic acid.
The inactive variety may be split into the component active
forms by means of its cinchonine salt (G. J. W. Bremer,
<i>Ber.</i>, 1880, 13, 352).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALIGNANT<a name="ar139" id="ar139"></a></span> (Lat. <i>malignus</i>, evil-disposed, from <i>maligenus</i>),
wicked, of a malicious or wilfully evil disposition. The word
was early applied by the Protestants to the Romanists, with an
allusion to the &ldquo;congregation of evil doers&rdquo; (Vulgate <i>Ecclesiam
malignantium</i>) of Psalm xxvi. 5. In English history, during
the Great Rebellion, the name was given to the Royalists by
the Parliamentary party. In the Great Remonstrance of 1641
occur the words &ldquo;the malignant partie, wherof the Archbishop
(Laud) and the earl of Strafford being heads.&rdquo; The name
throughout the period had special reference to the religious
differences between the parties. In medical science, the term
&ldquo;malignant&rdquo; is applied to a particularly virulent or dangerous
form which a disease may take, or to a tumour or growth of
rapid growth, extension to the lymphatic glands, and recurrence
after operation.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALIK IBN ANAS<a name="ar140" id="ar140"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 718-795), the founder of the Malikite
school of canon law, was born at Medina about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 718: the
precise date is not certain. He studied and passed his life
there, and came to be regarded as the greatest local authority
in theology and law. (For his legal system and its history see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mahommedan Law</a></span>.) His life was one of extreme honour and
dignity, but uneventful, being given to study, lecturing on law
and acting as muft&#299; and judge. Only two episodes stand out
in his biography. When Mahommed ibn &lsquo;Abdall&#257;h, the &lsquo;Alid,
rose in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 762 at Medina against the &lsquo;Abb&#257;sids, Malik gave a
<i>fatw&#257;</i>, or legal opinion, that the oath of allegiance to the
&lsquo;Abb&#257;sids was invalid, as extorted by force. For this independence
he was severely scourged by the &lsquo;Abb&#257;sid governor,
who, apparently, did not dare to go beyond scourging with a
man of his standing with the people. The second episode gave
equal proof of independence. In 795 H&#257;r&#363;n al-Rash&#299;d made
the pilgrimage, came with two of his sons to Medina, and sat
at the feet of Malik as he lectured in the mosque. The story,
legendary or historical, adds that Malik had refused to go to
the caliph, saying that it was for the student to come to his
teacher. Late in life he seems to have turned to asceticism and
contemplation. It is said that he retired from all active, public
life and even neglected plain, public duties, replying to reproaches,
&ldquo;Not every one can speak in his own excuse&rdquo; (Ibn
Qutaiba, <i>Ma &lsquo;&#257;rif</i>, 250). He is also entered among the early
ascetic S&#363;f&#299;s (cf. <i>Fihrist</i>, 183). He died in Medina, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 795.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALINES<a name="ar141" id="ar141"></a></span> (Flemish, <i>Mechelen</i>, called in the middle ages by
the Latin name Mechlinia, whence the spelling Mechlin), an
ancient and important city of Belgium, and the seat since 1559
of the only archbishopric in that country. Pop. (1904), 58,101.
The name is supposed to be derived from <i>maris linea</i>, and to
indicate that originally the sea came up to it. It is now situated
on the Dyle, and is in the province of Antwerp, lying about
half-way between Antwerp and Brussels. The chief importance
of Malines is derived from the fact that it is in a sense the
religious capital of Belgium&mdash;the archbishop being the primate
of the Catholic Church in that country. The archbishop&rsquo;s palace
is in a picturesque situation, and dates from the creation of the
dignity. The principal building in the city is the exceedingly
fine cathedral dedicated to St Rombaut. This cathedral was
begun in the 12th and finished early in the 14th century, and
although modified in the 15th after a fire, it remains one of the
most remarkable specimens of Gothic architecture in Europe.
The massive tower of over 300 ft., which is described as unfinished
because the original intention was to carry it to 500 ft., is its
most striking external feature. The people of Malines gained
in the old distich&mdash;&ldquo;gaudet Mechlinia stultis&rdquo;&mdash;the reputation
of being &ldquo;fools,&rdquo; because one of the citizens on seeing the moon
through the dormer windows of St Rombaut called out that the
place was on fire, and his fellow-citizens, following his example,
endeavoured to put out the conflagration until they realized the
truth. The cathedral contains a fine altar-piece by Van Dyck,
and the pulpit is in carved oak of the 17th century. Another
old palace is that of Margaret of Austria, regent for Charles V.,
which has been carefully preserved and is now used as a court
of justice. In the church of Notre Dame (16th century) is
Rubens&rsquo; masterpiece &ldquo;the miraculous draught of fishes,&rdquo; and
in that of St John is a fine triptych by the same master. Malines,
although no longer famous for its lace, carries on a large trade
in linen, needles, furniture and oil, while as a junction for the
line from Ghent to Louvain and Liège, as well as for that from
Antwerp to Brussels and the south, its station is one of the
busiest in Belgium, and this fact has contributed to the general
prosperity of the city.</p>

<p>The lordship of Malines was conferred as a separate fief by
Pippin the Short on his kinsman Count Adon in 754. In the
9th century Charles the Bald bestowed the fief on the bishop
of Liége, and after being shared between Brabant and Flanders
it passed into the hands of Philip the Bold, founder of the house
of Burgundy, in 1384. During the religious troubles of the 16th
century Malines suffered greatly, and in 1572 it was sacked by
Alva&rsquo;s troops during three days. In the wars of the 17th and
18th centuries it was besieged many times and captured by the
French, Dutch and English on several occasions. The French
finally removed the fortifications in 1804, since which year it
has been an open town.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALLARMÉ, FRANÇOIS RENÉ AUGUSTE<a name="ar143" id="ar143"></a></span> (1755-1835),
French Revolutionist, the son of a lawyer, was born at Nancy
on the 25th of February 1755. He was brought up in his father&rsquo;s
profession, and was appointed <i>procureur-syndic</i> of the district
of Pont-à-Mousson. During the Revolution he was elected by
the department of Meurthe deputy to the Legislative Assembly
and the Convention, where he attached himself to the Mountain
and voted for the death of Louis XVI. He was elected president
of the Convention on the 30th of May 1793, and by his weakness
during the crisis of the following day contributed much to the
success of the insurrection against the Girondists. He took an
active part in the <i>levée-en-masse</i>, and in November 1793 was
given the task of establishing the revolutionary government in
the departments of Meuse and Moselle, where he gained an
unenviable notoriety by ordering the execution of the sentence
of death decreed by the revolutionary tribunal on some young
girls at Verdun who had offered flowers to the Prussians when
they entered the town. After the fall of Robespierre he joined
the group of &ldquo;Thermidorians&rdquo; and was sent on mission to the
south of France, where he closed the Jacobin club at Toulouse
and set free a number of imprisoned &ldquo;suspects.&rdquo; On the 1st
of June 1795 he was denounced and arrested, but was soon set
at liberty. In 1796 he was appointed by the Directory commissioner
for the organization of the departments of Dyle and
Mont-Tonnerre. Under the empire he was receiver of the <i>droits
réunis</i> at Nancy, and lost his money in 1814 in raising a levy of
volunteers. Appointed sub-prefect of Avesnes during the Hundred
Days, he was imprisoned by the Prussians in revenge for
the death of the maidens of Verdun, and lived in exile during
the Restoration. He returned to France after the revolution
of 1830, and died at Richemont (Seine-Inférieure) on the 25th
of July 1835.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALLARMÉ, STÉPHANE<a name="ar144" id="ar144"></a></span> (1842-1898), French poet and
theorist, was born at Paris, on the 18th of March 1842. His
life was simple and without event. His small income as professor
of English in a French college was sufficient for his needs,
and, with his wife and daughter, he divided the year between
a fourth-floor flat in Paris and a cottage on the banks of the
Seine. His Tuesday evening receptions, which did so much to
form the thought of the more interesting of the younger French
men of letters, were almost as important a part of his career as
the few carefully elaborated books which he produced at long
intervals. <i>L&rsquo;Après-midi d&rsquo;un faune</i> (1876) and other fragments
of his verse and prose had been known to a few people long
before the publication of the <i>Poésies complètes</i> of 1887, in a
facsimile of his clear and elegant handwriting, and of the Pages
of 1891 and the <i>Vers et prose</i> of 1893. His remarkable translation
of poems of Poe appeared in 1888, &ldquo;The Raven&rdquo; having
been published as early as 1875, with illustrations by Manet.
<i>Divagations</i>, his own final edition of his prose, was published in
1897, and a more or less complete edition of the <i>Poésies</i>, posthumously,
in 1899. He died at Valvins, Fontainebleau, on the
9th of September 1898. All his life Mallarmé was in search of
a new aesthetics, and his discoveries by the way were often
admirable. But he was too critical ever to create freely, and
too limited ever to create abundantly. His great achievement
remains unfinished, and all that he left towards it is not
of equal value. There are a few poems and a few pieces of
imaginative prose which have the haunting quality of Gustave
Moreau&rsquo;s pictures, with the same jewelled magnificence, mysterious
and yet definite. His later work became more and more
obscure, as he seemed to himself to have abolished limit after
limit which holds back speech from the expression of the
absolute. Finally, he abandoned punctuation in verse, and
invented a new punctuation, along with a new construction,
for prose. Patience in the study of so difficult an author
has its reward. No one in our time has vindicated with more
pride the self-sufficiency of the artist in his struggle with the
material world. To those who knew him only by his writings
his conversation was startling in its clearness; it was always,
like all his work, at the service of a few dignified and misunderstood
ideas.</p>

of Bio-Bio on the N. and E., Cautin on the S. and Arauco on the
W. Area, 2973 sq. m. Pop. (1895), 98,032. It belongs to the
rainy, forested region of southern Chile, and is thinly populated,

<p><span class="bold">MALLEMUCK,<a name="ar146" id="ar146"></a></span> from the German rendering of the Dutch
<i>Mallemugge</i> (which originally meant small flies or midges that
madly whirl round a light), a name given by the early Dutch
Arctic voyagers to the Fulmar (<i>q.v.</i>), of which the English form
is nowadays most commonly applied by our sailors to the smaller
albatrosses, of about the size of a goose, met with in the Southern
Ocean&mdash;corrupted into &ldquo;molly mawk,&rdquo; or &ldquo;mollymauk.&rdquo; A
number of species have been identified. <i>Diomedea irrorata</i> of
West Peru is sooty-brown with white mottlings and a white head;
<i>D. migripes</i> of the North Pacific is similar in colour but with
white only near the eye and at the base of the tail and bill; <i>D.
immutabilis</i> of Japan is darker but has a white head. <i>D. melanophrys</i>
of the southern oceans has been found in summer both
in California, in England, and as far north as the Faeroes. According
to J. Gould the latter is the commonest species of albatross
inhabiting the Southern Ocean, and its gregarious habits and
familiar disposition make it well known to every voyager to or
from Australia, for it is equally common in the Atlantic as well
as the Pacific. The back, wings and tail are of a blackish-grey,
but all the rest of the plumage is white, except a dusky superciliary
streak, whence its name of black-browed albatross, as also
its scientific epithet, are taken. The bill of the adult is of an
ochreous-yellow, while that of the young is dark. This species
breeds on the Falkland Islands. <i>D. bulleri</i> of the New Zealand
seas is greyish-brown, with white underparts and rump and ashy
head. <i>Diomedea</i> (or <i>Thalassogeron</i>) <i>culminata</i> and <i>chlororhyncha</i>
of the southern seas, <i>D.</i> (or <i>T.</i>) <i>cauta</i> of Tasmania, <i>salvini</i> of New
Zealand and <i>layardi</i> of the Cape resemble <i>D. bulleri</i>, but have a
strip of naked skin between the plates of the maxilla towards its
base. H. N. Moseley (<i>Notes of a Naturalist</i>, 130) describes
<i>D. culminata</i> as making a cylindrical nest of grass, sedge and
clay, with a shallow basin atop and an overhanging rim&mdash;the
whole being about 14 in. in diameter and 10 in height. The bird
lays a single white egg, which is held in a sort of pouch, formed
by the skin of the abdomen, while she is incubating. The feet
of <i>D. bulleri</i> are red, of <i>D. chlororhyncha</i> flesh-coloured, of the
others yellow.</p>

and dramatist, the son of a Perthshire farmer, was born in that
county, probably in 1705. In 1717 he went to the high school
at Edinburgh, and some three years later to the university, where
he made the friendship of James Thomson, author of <i>The
Seasons</i>. As early as 1720 he began to publish short poems in
the manner of the period, a number of which appeared during
the next few years in collections such as the <i>Edinburgh Miscellany</i>
and Allan Ramsay&rsquo;s <i>Tea Table Miscellany</i>, in which his ballad
&ldquo;William and Margaret&rdquo; was published in 1724. For some
years from 1723 he was private tutor to the duke of Montrose&rsquo;s
sons, with whom he travelled on the Continent in 1727. His real
name was Malloch; but this he changed to Mallet in 1724. In
1735 he took the M.A. degree at Oxford. He had already made the
friendship of Pope, whose vanity he flattered in a poem on <i>Verbal
Criticism</i>, in 1733; and through Pope he became acquainted
with Bolingbroke and other Tory politicians, especially those
attached to the party of the prince of Wales, who in 1742 appointed
Mallet to be his paid secretary. After Pope&rsquo;s death, in
1744, Mallet, at the instigation of Bolingbroke and forgetful of
past favours and friendship, vilified the poet&rsquo;s memory, thereby
incurring the resentment of Pope&rsquo;s friends. For his services as
a party pamphleteer, in which character he published an attack
on Admiral Byng, Mallet received from Lord Bute a lucrative
sinecure in 1760. He died on the 21st of April 1765. Mallet
was a small man, in his younger days something of a dandy and
inordinately vain. He was twice married; by his first wife he
had a daughter, Dorothy, who married Pietro Paolo Celesia, a
Genoese gentleman, and was the author of several poems and
plays, notably <i>Almida</i>, produced by Garrick at Drury Lane in
1771.</p>

<p>Mallet&rsquo;s own works included several plays, some of which were
produced by Garrick, who was Mallet&rsquo;s personal friend. <i>Eurydice</i>,
a tragedy, with prologue and epilogue by Aaron Hill, was
produced at Drury Lane in 1731; <i>Mustapha</i>, also a tragedy, had
considerable success at the same theatre in 1739; in 1740, in
collaboration with Thomson, he produced the masque <i>Alfred</i>,
of which he published a new version in 1751, after Thomson&rsquo;s
death, claiming it to be almost entirely his own work. This
masque is notable as containing the well-known patriotic song,
&ldquo;Rule Britannia,&rdquo; the authorship of which has been attributed
to Mallet, although he allowed it to appear without protest in his
lifetime with Thomson&rsquo;s name attached. His other writings
include <i>Poems on Several Occasions</i> (1743); <i>Amyntor and Theodora,
or the Hermit</i> (1747); another volume of <i>Poems</i> (1762).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In 1759 a collected edition of Mallet&rsquo;s <i>Works</i> was published in three
volumes; and in 1857 his <i>Ballads and Songs</i> were edited by F.
Dinsdale with notes, and a biographical memoir of the author.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALLET, PAUL HENRI<a name="ar149" id="ar149"></a></span> (1730-1807), Swiss writer, was born
on the 20th of August 1730, in Geneva. After having been
educated there, he became tutor in the family of the count of
Calenberg in Saxony. In 1752 he was appointed professor of
<i>belles lettres</i> to the academy at Copenhagen. He was naturally
attracted to the study of the ancient literature and history of his
adopted country, and in 1755 he published the first fruits of his
researches, under the title <i>Introduction à l&rsquo;histoire du Danemarck
où l&rsquo;on traite de la religion, des m&oelig;urs, des lois, et des usages
des anciens Danois</i>. A second part, more particularly relating
to the ancient literature of the country, <i>Monuments de la mythologie
et de la poesie des Celtes, et particulièrement des anciens
Scandinaves</i>, was issued in 1756, and was also translated into
Danish. A translation into English, with notes and preface, by
Bishop Percy, was issued in 1770 under the title of <i>Northern
Antiquities</i> (republished with additions in 1847). The book had
a wide circulation, and attracted much attention on account of
its being the first (though a very defective) translation into
French of the <i>Edda</i>. The king of Denmark showed his appreciation
by choosing Mallet to be preceptor of the crown prince. In
1760 he returned to Geneva, and became professor of history in
his native city. While there he was requested by the czarina
to undertake the education of the heir-apparent of Russia (afterwards
the czar Paul I.), but declined the honour. An invitation
more congenial to his tastes led to his accompanying Lord
Mountstuart in his travels through Italy and thence to England,
where he was presented at court and commissioned to write the
history of the house of Brunswick. He had previously received
a similar commission from the landgrave of Hesse-Cassel for the
preparation of a history of the house of Hesse, and both works
were completed in 1785. The quietude of a literary life was
rudely broken by the shock of the Revolution, to which he was
openly hostile. His leanings to the unpopular side were so
obnoxious to his fellow-citizens that he was obliged to quit his
native country in 1792, and remained in exile till 1801. He died
at Geneva, on the 8th of February 1807.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A memoir of his life and writings, by Sismondi, was published at
Geneva in 1807. Besides the <i>Introduction to the History of Denmark</i>,
his principal works are: <i>Histoire du Danemarck</i> (3 vols., Copenhagen,
1758-1777); <i>Histoire de la maison de Hesse</i> (4 vols., 1767-1785);

<p><span class="bold">MALLET, ROBERT<a name="ar150" id="ar150"></a></span> (1810-1881), Irish engineer, physicist and
geologist, was born in Dublin, on the 3rd of June 1810. He was
educated at Trinity College in that city, and graduated B.A. in
1830. Trained as an engineer, he was elected M.Inst.C.E. in
1842; he built in 1848-1849 the Fastnet Rock lighthouse, south-west
of Cape Clear, and was engaged in other important works.
Devoting much attention to pure science, he became especially
distinguished for his researches on earthquakes, and from 1852-1858
he was engaged (with his son John William Mallet) in the
preparation of his great work, <i>The Earthquake Catalogue of the
British Association</i> (1858). In 1862 he published two volumes,
dealing with the <i>Great Neapolitan Earthquake of 1857</i> and <i>The
First Principles of Observational Seismology</i>. He then brought
forward evidence to show that the depth below the earth&rsquo;s
surface, whence came the impulse of the Neapolitan earthquake,
was about 8 or 9 geographical miles. One of his most important
essays was that communicated to the Royal Society (<i>Phil. Trans.</i>
clxiii. 147; 1874), entitled <i>Volcanic Energy: an Attempt to develop
its True Origin and Cosmical Relations</i>. He sought to show that
volcanic heat may be attributed to the effects of crushing, contortion
and other disturbances in the crust of the earth; the
disturbances leading to the formation of lines of fracture, more
or less vertical, down which water would find its way, and if the
temperature generated be sufficient volcanic eruptions of steam
or lava would follow. He was elected F.R.S. in 1854, and he
was awarded the Wollaston medal by the Geological Society of
London in 1877. He died at Clapham, London, on the 5th of
November 1881.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALLET DU PAN, JACQUES<a name="ar151" id="ar151"></a></span> (1749-1800), French journalist,
of an old Huguenot family, was born near Geneva in 1749, the
son of a Protestant minister. He was educated at Geneva, and
through the influence of Voltaire obtained a professorship at
Cassel. He soon, however, resigned this post, and going to
London joined H.S.N. Linguet in the production of his <i>Annales
politiques</i> (1778-1780). During Linguet&rsquo;s imprisonment in the
Bastille Mallet du Pan continued the <i>Annales</i> by himself (1781-1783);
but Linguet resented this on his release, and Mallet du
Pan changed the title of his own publication to <i>Mémoires historiques</i>
(1783). From 1783 he incorporated this work with the
<i>Mercure de France</i> in Paris, the political direction of which had
been placed in his hands. On the outbreak of the French
Revolution he sided with the Royalists, and was sent on a mission
(1791-1792) by Louis XVI. to Frankfort to try and secure the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page492" id="page492"></a>492</span>
sympathy and intervention of the German princes. From
Germany he travelled to Switzerland and from Switzerland to
Brussels in the Royalist interest. He published a number of
anti-revolutionary pamphlets, and a violent attack on Bonaparte
and the Directory resulted in his being exiled in 1797 to Berne.
In 1798 he came to London, where he founded the <i>Mercure
britannique</i>. He died at Richmond, Surrey, on the 10th of May
1800, his widow being pensioned by the English government.
Mallet du Pan has a place in history as a pioneer of modern
political journalism. His son <span class="sc">John Lewis Mallet</span> (1775-1861)
spent a useful life in the English civil service, becoming secretary
of the Board of Audit; and J. L. Mallet&rsquo;s second son, <span class="sc">Sir Louis
Mallet</span> (1823-1890) also entered the civil service in the Board
of Trade and rose to be a distinguished economist and a member

<p><span class="bold">MALLOCK, WILLIAM HURRELL<a name="ar153" id="ar153"></a></span> (1849-&emsp;&emsp;), English
author, was born at Cockington Court, Devonshire. He was
educated privately, and at Balliol College, Oxford. He won the
Newdigate prize in 1872, and took a second class in the final
classical schools in 1874. He attracted considerable attention
by his satirical story <i>The New Republic</i> (2 vols., 1877), in which
he introduced characters easily recognized as prominent living
men, Mark Pattison, Matthew Arnold, W. K. Clifford and others.
His keen logic and gift for acute exposition and criticism were
displayed in later years both in fiction and in controversial works.
In a series of books dealing with religious questions he insisted
on dogma as the basis of religion and on the impossibility of
founding religion on purely scientific data. In <i>Is Life Worth
Living?</i> (1879) and <i>The New Paul and Virginia</i> (1878) he
attacked Positivist theories, and in a volume on the intellectual
position of the Church of England, <i>Doctrine and Doctrinal Disruption</i>
(1900), he advocated the necessity of a strictly defined
creed. Later volumes on similar topics were <i>Religion as a
Credible Doctrine</i> (1903) and <i>The Reconstruction of Belief</i> (1905).
He published several brilliant works on economics, directed
against Radical and Socialist theories: <i>Social Equality</i> (1882),
<i>Property and Progress</i> (1884), <i>Labour and the Popular Welfare</i>
(1893), <i>Classes and Masses</i> (1896) and <i>Aristocracy and Evolution</i>
(1898); and among his anti-socialist works should be classed his
novel, <i>The Old Order Changes</i> (1886). His other novels include
<i>A Romance of the Nineteenth Century</i> (1881), <i>A Human Document</i>
(1892), <i>The Heart of Life</i> (1895) and <i>The Veil of the Temple</i> (1904).

<p><span class="bold">MALLOW,<a name="ar154" id="ar154"></a></span> a market town and watering place of Co. Cork,
Ireland, on the Blackwater, 144½ m. S.W. from Dublin, and 21 N.
from Cork by the Great Southern and Western railway. Pop.
(1901), 4542. It is a junction for lines westward to Killarney
and Co. Kerry, and eastward to Lismore and Co. Waterford.
The town owes its prosperity to its beautiful situation in a
fine valley surrounded by mountains, and possesses a tepid
mineral spring, considered efficacious in cases of general debility
and for scorbutic and consumptive complaints. A spa-house
with pump-room and baths was erected in 1828. The parish
church dates from 1818, but there are remains of an earlier
building adjoining it. There are manufactures of mineral water
and condensed milk, corn-mills and tanneries. Mallow received
a charter of incorporation from James I. Its name was originally
Magh Allo, that is, Plain of the Allo (the old name used by
Spenser for this part of the river), and the ford was defended by
a castle, built by the Desmonds, the ruins of which remain. A
bridge connects the town with the suburb of Ballydaheen.
Mallow is a centre for the fine salmon fishing on the Blackwater.
The climate is very mild. The town was a parliamentary
borough till 1885. It is governed by an urban district council.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALLOW,<a name="ar155" id="ar155"></a></span> botanically <i>Malva</i>, the typical genus of the natural
order Malvaceae, embracing about sixteen species of annual and
perennial herbaceous plants, widely distributed throughout the
northern hemisphere. The mallows possess the reniform one-celled
anthers which specially characterize the <i>Malvaceae</i> (<i>q.v.</i>).
The petals also are united by their base to the tube formed by
the coalesced filaments of the stamens. The special characters
which separate the genus <i>Malva</i> from others most nearly allied
to it are the involucre, consisting of a row of three separate bracts
attached to the lower part of the true calyx, and the numerous
single-seeded carpels disposed in a circle around a central axis,
from which they become detached when ripe. The flowers are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page493" id="page493"></a>493</span>
mostly white or pinkish, never yellow, the leaves radiate-veined,
and more or less lobed or cut. Three species are natives of
Britain. The musk mallow (<i>Malva moschata</i>) is a perennial
herb with five-partite, deeply-cut leaves, and large rose-coloured
flowers clustered together at the ends of the branched stems, and
is found growing along hedges and borders of fields, blossoming
in July and August. It owes its name to a slight musky odour
diffused by the plant in warm dry weather when it is kept in a
confined situation. The round-leaved dwarf mallow (<i>Malva
rotundifolia</i>) is a creeping perennial, growing in waste sandy
places, with roundish serrate leaves and small pinkish-white
flowers produced in the axils of the leaves from June to September.
It is common throughout Europe and the north of Africa,
extending to western and northern Asia. The common mallow
(<i>Malva sylvestris</i>), the <i>mauve</i> of the French, is an erect biennial
or perennial plant with long-stalked roundish-angular serrate
leaves, and conspicuous axillary reddish-purple flowers, blossoming
from May to September. Like most plants of the order it
abounds in mucilage, and hence forms a favourite domestic
remedy for colds and sore throats. The aniline dye called mauve
derives its name from its resemblance to the colour of this plant.</p>

<p class="pt2">The marsh mallow (<i>Althaea officinalis</i>), the <i>guimauve</i> of the French,
belongs to another genus having an involucre of numerous bracts.
It is a native of marshy ground near the sea or in the neighbourhood
of saline springs. It is an erect perennial herb, with somewhat woody
stems, velvety, ovate, acute, unequally serrate leaves, and delicate
pink showy flowers blooming from July to September. The flowers
are said to yield a good deal of honey to bees. The marsh mallow
is remarkable for containing asparagin, C<span class="su">4</span>H<span class="su">8</span>N<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span>, H<span class="su">2</span>O, which, if
the root be long kept in a damp place, disappears, butyric acid
being developed. The root also contains about 25% of starch and
the same quantity of mucilage, which differs from that of gum
arabic in containing one molecule less of water and in being
precipitated by neutral acetate of lead. It is used in <i>pâte de
guimauve</i> lozenges. <i>Althaea rosea</i> is the hollyhock (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>The mallow of Scripture, Job xxx. 4, has been sometimes identified
with Jew&rsquo;s mallow (<i>Corchorus olitorius</i>), a member of the closely allied
order Tiliaceae, but more plausibly (the word <span title="maluah">&#1502;&#1500;&#1493;&#1495;</span> implying a saline

<p><span class="bold">MALMESBURY, JAMES HARRIS,<a name="ar157" id="ar157"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st Earl of</span> (1746-1820),
English diplomatist, was born at Salisbury on the 21st of April
1746, being the son of James Harris (<i>q.v.</i>), the author of <i>Hermes</i>.
Educated at Winchester, Oxford and Leiden, young Harris
became secretary in 1768 to the British embassy at Madrid, and
was left as <i>chargé d&rsquo;affaires</i> at that court on the departure of Sir
James Grey until the arrival of George Pitt, afterwards Lord
Rivers. This interval gave him his opportunity; he discovered
the intention of Spain to attack the Falkland Islands, and was
instrumental in thwarting it by putting on a bold countenance.
As a reward he was appointed minister <i>ad interim</i> at Madrid,
and in January 1772 minister plenipotentiary to the court of
Prussia. His success was marked, and in 1777 he was transferred
to the court of Russia. At St Petersburg he made his reputation,
for he managed to get on with Catherine in spite of her predilections
for France, and steered adroitly through the accumulated
difficulties of the first Armed Neutrality. He was made a knight
of the Bath at the end of 1778, but in 1782 he returned home
owing to ill-health, and was appointed by his friend Fox to be
minister at the Hague, an appointment confirmed after some
delay by Pitt (1784). He did very great service in furthering
Pitt&rsquo;s policy of maintaining England&rsquo;s influence on the Continent
by the arms of her allies, and held the threads of the diplomacy
which ended in the king of Prussia&rsquo;s overthrowing the republican
party in Holland, which was inclined to France, and re-establishing
the prince of Orange. In recognition of his services he was
created Baron Malmesbury of Malmesbury (Sept. 1788), and
permitted by the king of Prussia to bear the Prussian eagle on
his arms, and by the prince of Orange to use his motto &ldquo;Je
maintiendrai.&rdquo; He returned to England, and took an anxious
interest in politics, which ended in his seceding from the Whig
party with the duke of Portland in 1793; and in that year he was
sent by Pitt, but in vain, to try to keep Prussia true to the first
coalition against France. In 1794 he was sent to Brunswick to
solicit the hand of the unfortunate Princess Caroline for the
prince of Wales, to marry her as proxy, and conduct her to her
husband in England. In 1796 and 1797 he was at Paris and
Lille vainly negotiating with the French Directory. After 1797
he became partially deaf, and quitted diplomacy altogether; but
for his long and eminent services he was in 1800 created earl of
Malmesbury, and Viscount Fitzharris, of Heron Court in the
county of Hants. He now became a sort of political Nestor,
consulted on foreign policy by successive foreign ministers,
trusted by men of the most different ideas in political crises, and
above all the confidant, and for a short time after Pitt&rsquo;s death
almost the political director, of Canning. Younger men were
also wont to go to him for advice, and Lord Palmerston particularly,
who was his ward, was tenderly attached to him, and owed
many of his ideas on foreign policy directly to his teaching. His
later years were free from politics, and till his death on the 21st
of November 1820 he lived very quietly and almost forgotten.
As a statesman, Malmesbury had an influence among his contemporaries
which is scarcely to be understood from his writings,
but which must have owed much to personal charm of manner
and persuasiveness of tongue; as a diplomatist, he seems to have
deserved his reputation, and shares with Macartney, Auckland
and Whitworth the credit of raising diplomacy from a profession
in which only great nobles won the prizes to a career
opening the path of honour to ability. He was succeeded as 2nd
earl by his son James Edward (1778-1841), under-secretary for
foreign affairs under Canning; from whom the title passed to
James Howard, 3rd earl of Malmesbury (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Malmesbury did not publish anything himself, except an account
of the Dutch revolution, and an edition of his father&rsquo;s works, but

grandson.</p>

on the 25th of March 1807, and educated at Eton and Oriel
College, Oxford. He led a life of travel for several years, making
acquaintance with famous people; and in 1841 he had only just
been elected to the House of Commons as a Conservative, when
his father died and he succeeded to the peerage. His political
career, though not one which made any permanent impression
on history, attracted a good deal of contemporary attention,
partly from his being foreign secretary in 1852 and again in
1858-1859 (he was also lord privy seal in 1866-1868 and in
1874-1876), and partly from his influential position as an active
Tory of the old school in the House of Lords at a time when Lord
Derby and Mr Disraeli were, in their different ways, moulding
the Conservatism of the period. Moreover his long life&mdash;he
survived till the 17th of May 1889&mdash;and the publication of his
<i>Memoirs of an Ex-Minister</i> in 1884, contributed to the reputation
he enjoyed. These <i>Memoirs</i>, charmingly written, full of
anecdote, and containing much interesting material for the
history of the time, remain his chief title to remembrance.
Lord Malmesbury also edited his grandfather&rsquo;s <i>Diaries and
Correspondence</i> (1844), and in 1870 published <i>The First Lord

It is governed by a mayor, 4 aldermen and 12 councillors.
Area, 178 acres.</p>

<p>Maildulphus, a Scottish or Irish monk, who came into England
about 635, built a hermitage near the site of the modern Malmesbury
(<i>Maildulphi-urbs</i>, <i>Maldelmesburh</i>, <i>Malmesbiri</i>) and gathered
disciples round him, thus forming the nucleus of the later abbey
of which Aldhelm his pupil became the first abbot. Æthelstan,
who was buried here (though his tomb in the church only dates
from the 16th century), rebuilt and endowed the monastery.
Round the abbey the town of Malmesbury grew up, and by the
time of the Domesday Survey it had become one of the only two
Wiltshire boroughs. The first charter, said to be a forgery,
purports to have been given by Æthelstan. It granted to the
burgesses all privileges and free customs such as they held in the
time of Edward the Elder, with many additional exemptions,
in return for help rendered against the Danes. The castle built
at Malmesbury during the reign of Henry I. gave a further
impetus to the growth of the town during the 12th and 13th
centuries. It was not incorporated, however, until 1645, when
it was made a free borough under the title of &ldquo;aldermen and
burgesses of the borough of Malmesbury, County Wilts.&rdquo; By
this charter it was governed until 1885. The borough returned
two members to parliament from 1295 to 1832 when the number
was reduced to one. Finally in 1885 its representation was
merged in that of the county. A grant of a yearly fair on
the 31st of March, the feast of St Aldhelm, was obtained from
William II., and another for three days from the 25th of July
from John. In 1792 fairs were held on the 28th of March,
the 28th of April and the 29th of June, but in 1891 they had
ceased entirely. John also granted a weekly market on
Thursday. In the 16th and 18th centuries it was held on
Saturday, and in 1891 on the third Wednesday in each month.
In the middle ages Malmesbury possessed a considerable cloth
manufacture, and at the Dissolution the abbey was bought by
a rich clothier and fitted with looms for weaving. The trade
in wool still flourished in 1751.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALMÖ,<a name="ar160" id="ar160"></a></span> a seaport of Sweden, chief town of the district (<i>län</i>)
of Malmöhus, on a small bay of the Sound, 384 m. S.S.W. of
Stockholm by rail. Pop. (1800), 38,054; (1900), 60,857. It is
connected with Copenhagen, 17¼ m. W. by N., by steam-ferry,
the Sound being kept open in winter by an ice-breaker. It is also
the first important station in Sweden on the Berlin-Stockholm
route, which crosses the sea between Sassnitz in Rügen and
Trelleborg, 20 m. S.E. of Malmö. The town, which stands
upon a level plain, formerly had strong fortifications, of which
only the citadel (Malmöhus) remains; in it the earl of Bothwell
was imprisoned by Frederick II. of Denmark for some time
after his departure from Scotland in 1567. The town-hall (1546,
largely restored in 1864) contains a handsome chamber, the
Knutssal, formerly used by the council of the gild of Canute.
The hall fronts the central square (<i>Stortorg</i>) which is planted
with trees and contains a colossal statue of Charles X. by Johan
Helenus Börjeson (b. 1835) erected in 1896. The most notable
church is that of St. Peter (<i>Peterkyrka</i>), dating in part from
1319. Malmö is second to Stockholm as an industrial centre.
There are breweries and large works for the manufacture of
machinery, among which may be mentioned the Kockum
mechanical works, with yards for the construction of vessels of
war, and others; of cotton and woollen goods, gloves, chocolate,
sweetmeats and tobacco. A large export trade is carried on in
butter and other agricultural produce, and matches. Coal is the
chief import. The harborage includes an outer harbour of
22 ft. depth, and two inner basins admitting vessels of 21 ft.
draught, with dry dock and patent slip. Malmö returns four
members to the second chamber of the Riksdag (parliament).</p>

<p>Malmö (Malmhauge, Malmey, Malmöye, Malmoughe), sometimes
called <i>Ancona Scanorum</i> or <i>Ellenbogen</i>, first appears in
history about the middle of the 13th century. During the
Hanseatic period it was the most important commercial town
on the Sound, but in the 16th and 17th centuries greatly lost
ground owing to the decay of its herring fisheries and the rise
of its rival, Copenhagen. Its modern prosperity is largely due
to the enterprise of Frans Snell, one of its merchants in the
second half of the 18th century, who first constructed the
harbour.</p>

oceanic enterprises. This was a Genoese expedition, which
about 1270 seems to have sailed into the <span class="correction" title="amended from Alantic">Atlantic</span>, re-discovered
the &ldquo;Fortunate Islands&rdquo; or Canaries, and made something
of a conquest and settlement in one of the most northerly isles
of this archipelago, still known (after the Italian captain) as
Lanzarote. According to a Spanish authority of about 1345,
the anonymous Franciscan&rsquo;s <i>Conosçimiento de todos los reinos</i>,
&ldquo;Lancarote&rdquo; was killed by the Canarian natives; but the castle
built by him was standing in 1402-1404, when it was utilized
for the storage of grain by the French conquerors under Gadifer
de la Salle. To Malocello&rsquo;s enterprise, moreover, it is probable
that Petrarch (born 1304) alludes when he tells how, within
the memory of his parents, an armed fleet of Genoese penetrated
to the &ldquo;Fortunatae&rdquo;; this passage some would refer, without
sufficient authority, to the expedition of 1291. Malocello&rsquo;s
name and nationality are certainly preserved by those early
<i>Portolani</i> or scientific charts (such as the &ldquo;Dulcert&rdquo; of 1339
and the &ldquo;Laurentian Portolano&rdquo; of 1351), in which the African
islands appear, for the first time in history, in clear and recognizable
form. Thus Dulcert reads <i>Insula de Lanzarotus</i> and
<i>Marocelus</i>, the Laurentian map <i>I. de Lanzarote</i>, against Lanzarote
Island, which is well depicted on both designs, and marked with
the cross of Genoa. The <i>Conosçimiento</i> (as noticed above)
explicitly derives the island-name from the Genoese commander
who perished here. Malocello&rsquo;s enterprise not only marks the
beginning of the oversea expansion of western Europe in exploration,
conquest and colonization (after the age of Scandinavian
world-roving had passed); it is also probably not unconnected
with the great Genoese venture of 1291 (in search of a waterway
to India, which soon follows), with which this attempt at
Canarian discovery and dominion has been by some unjustifiably
identified.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALONE, EDMOND<a name="ar164" id="ar164"></a></span> (1741-1812), Irish Shakespearian scholar
and editor, was born in Dublin, on the 4th of October 1741, the
son of a barrister and a member of the Irish House of Commons.
He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and was called to
the Irish bar in 1767. The death of his father in 1774 assured
him a competency, and he went to London, where he frequented
literary and artistic circles. He frequently visited Dr Johnson
and was of great assistance to Boswell in revising and proofreading
his <i>Life</i>, four of the later editions of which he annotated.
He was intimate with Sir Joshua Reynolds, to whom he sat for
a portrait now in the National Portrait Gallery. He was one
of Reynolds&rsquo; executors, and published a posthumous collection
of his works (1798) with a memoir. Horace Walpole, Burke,
Canning, Lord Charlemont, and, at first, George Steevens,
were among Malone&rsquo;s friends. Encouraged by the two last he
devoted himself to the study of Shakespearian chronology, and
the results of his &ldquo;Attempt to ascertain the Order in which the
Plays of Shakespeare were written&rdquo; (1778) are still largely
accepted. This was followed in 1780 by two supplementary
volumes to Steevens&rsquo;s version of Dr Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Shakespeare</i>,
partly consisting of observations on the history of the Elizabethan
stage, and of the text of doubtful plays; and this again, in 1783,
by an appendix volume. His refusal to alter some of his notes
to Isaac Reed&rsquo;s edition of 1785, which disagreed with Steevens&rsquo;s,
resulted in a quarrel with the latter. The next seven years
were devoted to Malone&rsquo;s own edition of Shakespeare in eleven
volumes, of which his essays on the history of the stage, his
biography of Shakespeare, and his attack on the genuineness
of the three parts of Henry VI., were especially valuable. His
editorial work was lauded by Burke, criticized by Walpole
and damned by Joseph Ritson. It certainly showed indefatigable
research and proper respect for the text of the earlier
editions. Malone published a denial of the claim to antiquity
of the Rowley poems (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chatterton</a></span>), and in this (1782) as in
his branding (1796) of the Ireland MSS. (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ireland, William
Henry</a></span>) as forgeries, he was among the first to guess and state
the truth. His elaborate edition of Dryden&rsquo;s works (1800),
with a memoir, was another monument to his industry, accuracy
and scholarly care. In 1801 the university of Dublin made
him an LL.D. At the time of his death, on the 25th of April
1812, Malone was at work on a new octavo edition of Shakespeare,
and he left his material to James Boswell the younger; the result
was the edition of 1821&mdash;generally known as the Third Variorum
edition&mdash;in twenty-one volumes. Lord Sunderlin (1738-1816),
his elder brother and executor, presented the larger part of
Malone&rsquo;s splendid collection of books, including dramatic
varieties, to the Bodleian Library, which afterwards bought
many of his MS. notes and his literary correspondence. The
British Museum also owns some of his letters and his annotated
copy of Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary</i>.</p>

tourists visit the Great North Woods, in the Adirondack foothills,
about 15 m. distant. Iron ore and Potsdam sandstone
are found near Malone. In the surrounding region hops,

Malone, being on the line of communication between lakes
Champlain and Ontario, was of strategic importance in the
war of 1812, and later was twice the rendezvous of Fenians
for attacks on Canada. The township of Malone was settled
and erected from Chateaugay in 1805. The village was first
known as Harison, was named Ezraville, in honour of Ezra
L&rsquo;Hommedieu, in 1808, received its present name in 1812, and

form of its calcium salt in the sugar beet. It was first prepared
in 1858 by V. Dessaignes, who obtained it by oxidizing malic
acid (<i>Ann.</i>, 1858, 107, p. 251). It may also be obtained by oxidizing
allylene and propylene with cold potassium permanganate
solution, by the hydrolysis of barbituric acid (malonyl urea)
with alkalis (A. Baeyer, <i>Ann.</i>, 1864, 130, p. 143); by the hydrolysis
of cyanacetic acid (H. Kolbe, <i>Ann.</i>, 1864, 131, p. 349; H. Muller,
<i>Ann.</i>, 1864, 131, p. 352), and by the action of silver oxide on

<p class="noind">It crystallizes in monoclinic tables, and is readily soluble in
water, alcohol and ether. The acid melts at 132° C., and at a
higher temperature it rapidly decomposes into acetic acid and
carbon dioxide. When heated with bromine and water to
100° C. it forms tribromacetic acid, some bromoform being
produced at the same time. Malonic acid, as well as its esters,
is characterized by the large number of condensation products
it can form. In the presence of a dehydrating agent (such as
acetic anhydride), it combines with aldehydes to form compounds
of the type R·CH:C(COOH)<span class="su">2</span>, or their decomposition
products (formed by loss of CO<span class="su">2</span>) R·CH:CH·COOH.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Many salts of the acid are known and, with the exception of those
of the alkali metals, they are difficultly soluble in water. Many
esters of malonic acid have been prepared, the most important
being the <i>diethyl ester</i> (<i>malonic ester</i>), CH<span class="su">2</span>(COOC<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">5</span>)<span class="su">2</span>, which is
obtained by dissolving monochloracetic acid in water, neutralizing
the solution with potassium carbonate, and then adding potassium
cyanide and warming the mixture until the reaction begins. When
the reaction has finished, the whole is evaporated and heated to about
130°-140° C. and then allowed to cool. The mass is then covered
with two-thirds of its weight of alcohol, and saturated with hydrochloric
acid gas. The whole is then poured into ice-cold water,
extracted by ether and the ethereal solution distilled (L. Claisen,
<i>Ann.</i>, 1883, 218, p. 131). It is a colourless liquid boiling at 197°.7-198°.2 C.
(W. H. Perkin). It is a most important synthetic
reagent; with sodium or sodium ethylate it forms sodio-malonic
ester, which reacts readily with alkyl halides, forming alkyl malonic
esters, which are again capable of forming sodium derivatives,
that by further treatment with alkyl halides yield the di-alkyl malonic
esters. These esters are readily hydrolysed and yield the mono- and
di-alkyl malonic acids which, on heating, are readily decomposed,
with evolution of carbon dioxide and the formation of mono- and
di-alkyl acetic acids. The scheme of reactions is shown thus:</p>

<p class="noind">When sodio-malonic ester is heated to 145° C., it undergoes condensation,
with elimination of alcohol and formation of the benzene
derivative, <i>phloroglucin tricarboxylic ester</i>. The addition of urea
to an alcoholic solution of sodio-malonic ester results in the formation
of barbituric acid (A. Michael, <i>Jour. pr. Chem.</i>, 1887 [2], 35, p. 456)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page496" id="page496"></a>496</span>
The half nitrile of malonic acid is <i>cyanacetic acid</i>, CN·CH·<span class="su">2</span> COOH,
which, in the form of its ester, may be obtained by the action of a
solution of potassium cyanide on monochloracetic acid. The solution
obtained is neutralized, concentrated on the water-bath, acidified
by sulphuric acid and extracted with ether. It is then converted
into the lead salt, which is decomposed by sulphuretted hydrogen
and the solution is carefully concentrated (Th. Meves, <i>Ann.</i>, 1867,
143, p. 201). It melts at 70° C. and at higher temperatures decomposes,
with evolution of carbon dioxide and formation of aceto-nitrile,
CH<span class="su">3</span>·CN. The true nitrile of malonic acid is <i>methylene cyanide</i>,
CH<span class="su">2</span>(CN)<span class="su">2</span>, which is obtained by distilling a mixture of cyanacetamide
and phosphorus pentoxide. It is a crystalline solid, which

<p><span class="bold">MALORY, SIR THOMAS,<a name="ar167" id="ar167"></a></span> translator and compiler of the
famous English classic, the <i>Morte d&rsquo;Arthur</i>. Previous to the
publication of Professor Kittredge&rsquo;s monograph, <i>Who was Sir
Thomas Malory?</i> the identity of this writer remained an unsolved
problem. Mr. Sidney Lee, in the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>,
was compelled to admit that he could find no one of
that name fulfilling the necessary conditions. Of direct evidence
we have very little; in the concluding passage of the book the
author asks the prayers of the reader for &ldquo;Syr Thomas Maleore
knyght,&rdquo; and states that the book was ended &ldquo;the ix. yere of the
reygne of Kyng Edward the fourth.&rdquo; Caxton, in his preface,
says that he printed the book &ldquo;after a copye unto me delivered
whyche copye Syr Thomas Malorye dyd take oute of certeyn
bookes of frensshe and reduced it in to Englysshe&rdquo;; in his
colophon he repeats this statement, adding that he himself is
responsible for the division of the work into books and chapters,
and that it was printed in 1485. It will be noted that Caxton
does not say that he received the book from Malory, only that
he had received a copy made by Malory; from this Professor
Kittredge draws the conclusion that the compiler was no longer
living. The problem then is to find a Thomas Malory who
was (<i>a</i>) a knight, (<i>b</i>) alive in the ninth year of King Edward IV.
(Mar. 4, 1469-Mar. 3, 1470), and (<i>c</i>) who was no longer living
in July (or June) 1485.</p>

<p>All these conditions Professor Kittredge finds fulfilled in the
life of Sir Thomas Malory, knight, of Newbold Revell (or Fenny
Newbold), M.P. for Warwickshire in 1445. The date of Sir
Thomas&rsquo;s birth is uncertain, but he succeeded his father,
Sir John, in 1433 or 1434. Previously to this he had served in
France, in the retinue of the earl of Warwick, most probably
during the time that that nobleman held the office of captain
of Calais. It seems probable that he is also to be identified
with a &ldquo;Thomas Malorie, miles,&rdquo; who in 1468 was, on account
of the part played by him in the Wars of the Roses, excluded
with several others from the operation of a pardon issued by
Edward IV. As, however, on the death of Sir Thomas on the
14th of March 1470, there was no difficulty as to inheritance,
his estates passing to his grandson, he must, if this identification
be correct, have come under the general amnesty of 1469. It
will be seen, therefore, that so far as it is in our power to state
the question this Sir Thomas Malory fulfils all the necessary
conditions.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the career of the earl of Warwick
in France was marked by certain picturesque and chivalric
features which might well impress the imagination of a young
retainer. John Rous, in his <i>Life of Richard Earl of Warwick</i>,
tells us that at a certain tourney held near Calais at Christmastide,
Earl Richard appeared three days running in different
armour, overthrowing his adversary on each occasion&mdash;an exploit
obviously imitated from the chivalric romances of the period.</p>

<p>The work with which Malory&rsquo;s name is connected is an
abridged compilation of the great body of Arthurian romance in
its latest form. The <i>Merlin</i> (Vulgate and Suite), <i>Tristan</i>, <i>Lancelot</i>,
<i>Queste</i> and <i>Mort Artus</i> are all represented, the only branch
omitted is that dealing with the &ldquo;early history&rdquo; of the Grail,
the <i>Joseph of Arimathea</i> and <i>Grand S. Graal</i>. Thanks mainly
to the labours of Dr Oskar Sommer, we can now assign the
majority of the books to their separate sources, although certain
stories, such as the adventures of Sir Gareth under the pseudonym
of Beaumains, the handling of Sir Urre of Hungary, and the
details of the abduction of Guenevere by Meleagaunt, still
remain unidentified. But we do not yet know whether Malory
himself was responsible for this selection, or whether he found
it ready to hand in a MS., the &ldquo;Frensshe Booke&rdquo; to which he
often refers. To make such a compilation at first hand, considering
the extent of the ground covered, would involve an
enormous amount of study and selection, and the access to a
very large library&mdash;conditions which scarcely seem to fit in
with the social position and activities of Sir Thomas. On the
other hand it is undeniable that the medieval copyists, at
the instance of their patrons, did make compilations from the
various romances within their reach, such as <i>e.g.</i> the enormous
codex 112 (<i>fonds Franç.</i>) of the Bibliothèque Nationale, which
includes large sections of the <i>Tristan</i>, the <i>Lancelot</i>, and the
<i>Merlin</i> Suite. Taking into consideration alike what Malory
retains and what he omits, it seems most probable that he was
in possession, not of complete copies of the romances, but of one
or more volumes of compilations from these sources.</p>

<p>From the point of view of matter it must be admitted that
the <i>Morte d&rsquo; Arthur</i> does not represent the Arthurian cycle at its
best, but rather in the period of its decadence; nor does Malory
in any way endeavour to overcome the difficulties caused by
the juxtaposition of a number of independent (and often contradictory)
versions. This is especially noticeable in his treatment
of Gawain; in the section derived from the <i>Lancelot</i> and
<i>Mort Artus</i> he is a good and valiant knight, &ldquo;a ful noble knyghte
as ever was borne,&rdquo; in those derived from the <i>Tristan</i> and the
<i>Queste</i>, he is treacherous, dissolute, and a murderer of good
knights.</p>

<p>The great charm of Malory&rsquo;s work lies in his style; stately,
earnest and dignified, it has lent to the relations between Lancelot
and Guenevere a character of truth and vitality in which the
French original is wholly lacking. Malory achieved a remarkable
feat&mdash;he took the Arthurian story in its worst and weakest
form and he imparted to it a moral force and elevation which
the cycle, even in its earlier and finer stage, had, save in the
unique case of Von Eschenbach&rsquo;s <i>Parzival</i>, never possessed.
While genuine lovers of the Arthurian cycle must regret that
the romances should only be known to the great majority of
English readers through the versions of Malory and Tennyson,
it is impossible to withhold from the <i>Morte d&rsquo; Arthur</i> the admiration
due to an imperishable monument of English language and
literature.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALOT, HECTOR HENRI<a name="ar168" id="ar168"></a></span> (1830-1907), French novelist
and man of letters, the son of a notary, was born at La Bouille
(Seine Inférieure) on the 20th of May 1830. He studied law
at Rouen and Paris, but literature early absorbed his attention.
He collaborated in the <i>Biographie générale</i> of Didot, became
literary critic of <i>L&rsquo;Opinion Nationale</i>, and dramatic critic of the
<i>Lloyd français</i>. He is the author of a long series of popular
novels dealing with contemporary life, including: a trilogy of
domestic novels entitled <i>Victimes d&rsquo;amour</i> (1859, 1865, 1866);
<i>Un Beau frère</i> (1869); <i>Madame Obernin</i> (1870); <i>Le Docteur Claude</i>
(1879); <i>Justice</i> (1889). <i>Les Aventures de Romain Kalbris</i> (1869)
and <i>Sans famille</i> (1888) are excellent stories for children. A
complete edition of Hector Malot&rsquo;s works appeared in 1894-1897.

<p><span class="bold">MALOU, JULES ÉDOUARD XAVIER<a name="ar169" id="ar169"></a></span> (1810-1886), Belgian
statesman, one of the leaders of the clerical party, was born at
Ypres on the 19th of October 1810. He was a civil servant
in the department of justice when he was elected to the Chamber
of Deputies by his native constituency in 1841, and was for
some time governor of the province of Antwerp. He was minister
of finance in the coalition ministry of J. B. Nothomb in 1844,
and formed with B. T. de Theux a Catholic cabinet in 1846,
which was overthrown in the Liberal victory of 1847. Malou
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page497" id="page497"></a>497</span>
then became a member of the senate, and his party only regained
ascendancy in 1870. The extreme clerical ministry of Baron
d&rsquo;Anethan retired in December 1871 after serious rioting in
Brussels, and Malou was the real, though not the nominal, head
of the more moderate clerical administrations of de Theux and
Aspremont-Lynden (1870-1878). He was wise enough to disavow
the noisy sympathy of Belgian Ultramontane politicians with the
German victims of the <i>Kulturkampf</i>, and, retaining in his own
hands the portfolio of finance, he subordinated his clerical policy
to a useful administration in commercial matters, including a
development of the railway system. It was only after the fall
of the ministry in 1878 that he adopted a frankly clerical policy,
and when he became chief of a new government in June 1884
he proceeded to undo the educational compromise of his predecessors
in the Frère-Orban ministry. His legislation in
favour of the Catholic schools caused rioting in Brussels, and
in October the king demanded the retirement of MM. Jacobs
and Woeste, the members of the cabinet against whom popular
indignation was chiefly directed. Malou followed them into
retirement, and died at Woluwe Saint Lambert, in Brabant, on
the 11th of July 1886. He was a financier of great knowledge
and experience, and his works (of which a long list is given
in Koninck&rsquo;s <i>Bibliographie nationale de Belgique</i>) include three
series (1874-1880) of memoirs on financial questions, edited
by him for the Chamber of Deputies, besides pamphlets on
railroad proposals, mining and other practical questions. His
brother Jean Baptiste Malou (1809-1864) was a well-known
divine.</p>

publicist and politician, was born at Riom (Puy-de-Dôme) on the
11th of February 1740, the son of a lawyer. He entered the
civil service and was employed successively at the French embassy
in Lisbon, in the administrative department of the duc de
Broglie&rsquo;s army, as commissary in San Domingo from 1767-1774,
and, after his return to France, as commissary-general of the
marine. In 1776 he was entrusted to carry out plans of colonization
in French Guiana, but was superseded in 1779. On his
return to France he was well received at court, and the execution
of his plans in Guiana was assured. He became intendant of
the port of Toulon, and in 1789 was returned to the states-general,
where he soon became well known as a defender of the
monarchical principle. He emigrated to England in September,
1792, but shortly afterwards sought in vain permission to return
to assist in the defence of Louis XVI. His name was erased from
the list of emigrants in 1801 by Napoleon, who restored him to
his position in the service and sent him to Antwerp as commissioner-general
and maritime prefect to superintend the
erection of defence works, and the creation of a fleet. He
entered the council of state in 1810, but, having offended the
emperor by his plainness of speech, he was disgraced in 1812.
At the Restoration, Louis XVIII. made him minister of marine;

<p><span class="bold">MALPIGHI, MARCELLO<a name="ar171" id="ar171"></a></span> (1628-1694), Italian physiologist,
was born at Crevalcuore near Bologna, on the 10th of March
1628. At the age of seventeen he began the study of philosophy;
it appears that he was also in the habit of amusing himself with
the microscope. In 1649 he started to study medicine; after
four years at Bologna he graduated there as doctor. He at
once applied to be admitted to lecture in the university, but it
was not till after three years (1656) that his request was granted.
A few months later he was appointed to the chair of theoretical
medicine at Pisa, where he enjoyed the friendship and countenance
of G. A. Borelli. At the end of four years he left Pisa,
on the ground of ill-health, and returned to Bologna. A call
to be professor primarius at Messina (procured for him through
Borelli, who had in the meantime become professor there)
induced him to leave Bologna in 1662. His engagement at
Messina was for a term of four years, at an annual stipend of
1000 scudi. An attempt was made to retain him at Messina
beyond that period, but his services were secured for his native
university, and he spent the next twenty-five years there. In
1691, being then in his sixty-fourth year, and in failing health,
he removed to Rome to become private physician to Pope
Innocent XII., and he died there of apoplexy three years later,
on the 30th of November 1694. Shortly before his death, he
drew up a long account of his academical and scientific labours,
correspondence and controversies, and committed it to the charge
of the Royal Society of London, a body with which he had
been in intimate relations for more than twenty years. The autobiography,
along with some other posthumous writings, was
published in London in 1696, at the cost of the Society. The
personal details left by Malpighi are few and dry. His narrative
is mainly occupied with a summary of his scientific contributions
and an account of his relations to contemporary anatomists,
and is entirely without graces of style or elements of ordinary
human interest.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Malpighi was one of the first to apply the microscope to the study
of animal and vegetable structure; and his discoveries were so important
that he may be considered to be the founder of microscopic
anatomy. It was his practice to open animals alive, and some of
his most striking discoveries were made in those circumstances.
Although Harvey had correctly inferred the existence of the capillary
circulation, he had never seen it; it was reserved for Malpighi in 1661
(four years after Harvey&rsquo;s death) to see for the first time the marvellous
spectacle of the blood coursing through a network of small
tubes on the surface of the lung and of the distended urinary bladder
of the frog. We are enabled to measure the difficulties of microscopic
observation at the time by the fact that it took Malpighi
four years longer to reach a clear understanding of the corpuscles in
the frog&rsquo;s blood, although they are the parts of the blood by which
its movement in the capillaries is made visible. His discovery of
the capillary circulation was given to the world in the form of two
letters <i>De Pulmonibus</i>, addressed to Borelli, published at Bologna
in 1661 and reprinted at Leiden and other places in the years following;
these letters contained also the first account of the vesicular
structure of the human lung, and they made a theory of respiration
for the first time possible. The achievement that comes next both
in importance and in order of time was a demonstration of the plan
of structure of secreting glands; against the current opinion (revived
by F. Ruysch forty years later) that the glandular structure was
essentially that of a closed vascular coil from which the secretion
exuded, he maintained that the secretion was formed in terminal
acini standing in open communication with the ducts. The name
of Malpighi is still associated with his discovery of the soft or mucous
character of the lower stratum of the epidermis, of the vascular coils
in the cortex of the kidney, and of the follicular bodies in the spleen.
He was the first to attempt the finer anatomy of the brain, and his
descriptions of the distribution of grey matter and of the fibre-tracts
in the cord, with their extensions to the cerebrum and cerebellum,
are distinguished by accuracy; but his microscopic study of
the grey matter conducted him to the opinion that it was of glandular
structure and that it secreted the &ldquo;vital spirits.&rdquo; At an early
period he applied himself to vegetable histology as an introduction
to the more difficult study of the animal tissues, and he was acquainted
with the spiral vessels of plants in 1662. It was not till
1671 that he wrote his <i>Anatome plantarum</i> and sent it to the
Royal Society, who published it in the following year. An English
work under a similar title (<i>Anatomy of Vegetables</i>) had been published
in London a few months earlier, by Nehemiah Grew; so that
Malpighi&rsquo;s priority as a vegetable histologist is not so incontestable
as it is in animal histology. The <i>Anatome plantarum</i> contained an
appendix, <i>Observations de ovo incubato</i>, which gave an account
(with good plates) of the development of the chick (especially of the
later stages) in many points more complete than that of Harvey,
although the observations were needlessly lessened in value by being
joined to the metaphysical notion of &ldquo;praedelineation&rdquo; in the
undeveloped ovum.</p>

<p>He also wrote <i>Epistolae anatomicae Marc. Malpighii et Car.
Fracassati</i> (Amsterdam, 1662) (on the tongue, brain, skin, omentum,
&amp;c.); <i>De viscerum structura: exercitatio anatomica</i> (London, 1669);
<i>De structura glandularum conglobatarum</i> (London, 1689); <i>Opera
posthuma, et vita a seipso scripta</i> (London, 1697; another edition,
with preface and additions, was published at Amsterdam in 1700.).
An edition containing all his works except the last two was published
in London in 1687, in 2 vols. folio, with portrait and plates.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALPLAQUET<a name="ar172" id="ar172"></a></span>, a village of France in the department of
the Nord, close to the Belgian frontier and about 10 miles S. by
E. of Mons, famous as the scene of the battle, September 1709,
between the Allies under the duke of Marlborough and Prince
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page498" id="page498"></a>498</span>
Eugène and the French commanded by Marshal Villars, in
which the former were victorious. The country to the west
and south of Mons is enclosed by a semicircular wall of woods
and broken ground, through which there are only two important
gaps&mdash;that of Jemappes (famous in 1792) to the west, and that
of Aulnois, in which stands the village of Malplaquet, to the
south. In the latter gap and the woods on either side Villars
took up his position facing north-eastwards, on August 29/September
9. The forces in presence, over 90,000 on each side,
were exceptionally large, and the French army in particular
represented the spirit of its nation to a degree unusual in the
armies of that time. Villars was the best general in the service
of Louis XIV. and the veteran Marshal Boufflers, though senior
to him, had volunteered to serve as his second in command.
Marlborough and Eugène lay with their army between Mons
and the French camps, which were almost within cannon shot.
Marlborough&rsquo;s own wish was for an immediate battle, but he
was opposed by the Dutch deputies at his headquarters, and
even by Eugène, so that it was only on August 31/September
11 that the attack actually took place. Villars had made
full use of his respite. The French right stood at the fringe
of the wood of Lanière, the left was strongly posted in the
midst of the wood of Taisnière, and across the two and a half
miles of open ground between the woods the position was entrenched
with several successive lines of works. The troops
were almost equally distributed along the whole line as usual,
and the cavalry was massed in rear of the infantry. In
the Allied army the mounted troops were also kept back,
but for the most part distributed to the various infantry
commands.</p>

<p>The intention of Marlborough and Eugène, when on the
morning of the battle they examined this formidable position,
was to deliver the main attack upon the French left wing,
combining the assaults of several columns on its front and
flanks. In this quarter the French not only held the interior
of the wood but also were thrown forward so as to occupy
the edges of its north-eastern salient, and upon the two faces
of this salient Count Lottum (1650-1719) with the Prussians,
and Count von der Schulenburg (1661-1747) with the Austrian
infantry were to deliver a double attack, while farther to the
Allied right a column under the English General Withers was
detached to make a wide turning movement through the woods.
Marlborough took command on the right, Eugène on the left.
The centre, which was intended only to observe the enemy
until the decision had been forced at the wood of Taisnière,
consisted of Lord Orkney&rsquo;s British corps and the prince of
Orange&rsquo;s Dutch contingent. These extended across the Trouée
d&rsquo;Aulnois as soon as the combined attack of Lottum and
Schulenburg opened. The general advance was covered by
a heavy cannonade, and the salient of the Taisnière wood was
duly attacked on its two faces by the Prussians and Austrians
about 9 a.m. They encountered a sterner resistance than
in any of the battles and combats of the past seven campaigns,
for on this field the defenders were fighting, not as hitherto
for the interests of their king, but to defend their country,
and the regiments of Picardie and Champagne which held
the salient were the oldest and most famous of the French
line. Lottum attacked the works on the eastern edge, again
and again without success, until three British battalions had
to be sent to reinforce him, and Marlborough placed himself
with a corps of cavalry in close support. At last the entrenchments
were stormed. Schulenburg, with the Austrians, had
by this time fought his way through the woods and undergrowth,
and the united force pressed back the French farther
and farther into the wood. Still, so stubborn was the defence
and so dense the wood that the impetus of the assault died
away and the troops on both sides broke up into small disconnected
bodies, fighting too fiercely to be amenable to superior
control.</p>

<p>But the French were not reinforced from their right wing
as Villars expected. The prince of Orange, far from merely
observing the hostile right as he had been ordered to do,
committed his corps, very early in the battle, to a serious assault
upon it, which Boufflers repulsed with enormous loss. The
Dutch infantry never recovered from its casualties on this
day, and the memory of Malplaquet was strong even at Fontenoy
nearly forty years afterwards. Some Hanoverian troops
which took part in this futile attack suffered equally heavily.
The only advantage to the Allies&mdash;an advantage which, as
it happened, counted for much&mdash;was that Boufflers did not
dare to send reinforcements to the hard-pressed left wing.
Thanks to this the Austrians and Prussians, with the English
detached to their aid, made steady progress in the wood of
Taisnière. Villars launched the &ldquo;Irish brigade&rdquo; to check
the advance of the Allies, and this famous corps charged into
the forest. Villars, Eugène and Marlborough personally led
their troops in the encounter which followed. Eugène was
wounded, but refused to quit the field. Villars was more
seriously hurt, and after trying in vain to direct the fighting
from a chair was carried insensible from the field. At this
crisis General Withers, who commanded the force that had
been ordered to turn the French extreme left, and had fought
his way through the forest, appeared on the scene. The British
18th regiment (Royal Irish), encountering the French <i>Royal
Irlandais</i>, put it to the rout, and Villars&rsquo;s counterstroke was
at an end. The French maintained themselves on this side
only by the aid of troops drawn from the centre and right,
and this gave the Allied centre the opportunity which the
prince of Orange had so rashly anticipated. The great attack
over the open was carried out, in spite of the previous repulse,
with the greatest determination. Preceded by forty guns,
the corps of the prince of Orange and Lord Orkney swiftly
carried the first line of works. The Allied cavalry then pushed
out to the front, and horse, foot and artillery were combined
in the last advance. Boufflers&rsquo;s cavalry masses, coming into
play for the first time, fought hard, and the struggle fluctuated
with the arrival of successive reserves on either side, but in
the end, shortly before 3 p.m., Boufflers (who had been in
command since Villars&rsquo;s fall) decided to retreat. The Allies
had no troops left intact for the pursuit, and those engaged
had expended their last efforts. Moreover Boufflers, experienced
soldier as he was, drew off his men before they had lost their
order and discipline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page499" id="page499"></a>499</span></p>

<p>Thus this &ldquo;very murdering battle&rdquo; as Marlborough called
it&mdash;the last and greatest pitched battle of the war&mdash;was almost
barren of results. The Allies lost not less than twenty thousand
men, or nearly a quarter of the whole force, the thirty battalions
of the Dutch infantry losing half their numbers. On the French
side there were some twelve thousand casualties. If further
evidence were necessary to prove that the French fought their
hardest, it could be found in the fact that whereas in almost
every other battle, from 1660 to 1792, there were deserters
and prisoners by the thousand, at Malplaquet only 500 of the
French fell into the hands of the victors unwounded.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALSTATT-BURBACH<a name="ar173" id="ar173"></a></span>, a town of Germany, in the Prussian
Rhine province on the right bank of the Saar (Sarre), which
separates it from Saarbrücken. Pop. (1900), 31,195. It lies
in the midst of an important coal-mining and industrial district,
and is itself little more than a long and narrow row of manufactories
and workmen&rsquo;s houses. The largest factories are
engaged in the production of iron, steel and cement. There is
a large wharf on the river for the export of coal.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Malstatt received municipal rights in 1321. These, however,
were afterwards resigned to the newer town of Saarbrücken, and in
1818 Malstatt and Burbach were two small villages with a joint
population of only about 800. About the middle of the century
the population began to increase rapidly, in consequence of the
development of the mining industry of the district and the extension
of the railway system, and in 1874 the two villages were united to
form a town.</p>

<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">MALT<a name="ar174" id="ar174"></a></span> (O. Eng., <i>mealt</i>; O. Sax., <i>malt</i>; O. Teut., <i>maltos</i>; Mod.
Ger., <i>Malz</i>; Scand., <i>malt</i>; probably derived from the Sanskrit
<i>mrdu</i>, soft, thus having reference to the fact that malt is raw
grain rendered soft or tender), the name given to grain in which
germination has been caused to proceed to a certain stage and
has then been arrested by the removal of water and the application
of heat. During this limited germination enzymes are
developed (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fermentation</a></span>), and the constituents of the grain
modified so that the finished malt, when ground and submitted
to the mashing process (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Brewing</a></span>), differs from the original
raw grain in that the greater portion dissolves. This solubility
is, however, a direct one to a slight extent only; it is due for
the most part to the action of the malt enzymes, diastase, &amp;c.
on the constituents of the grain, the main portion of which are
of themselves insoluble. Thus starch, the main constituent of
all graminaceous seeds, probably exists in the same condition
in raw grain and in malt. When however the malt is mashed,
the starch is attacked by the enzyme diastase, and converted
by the process of hydrolysis into a mixture of soluble compounds,
<i>e.g.</i> the crystalline sugar, maltose, and a number of gummy
substances known as maltodextrins. But to a certain extent
starch and other carbohydrate substances are rendered directly
soluble and diffusible during the malting process, some of
the products serving the respiratory needs of the growing germ,
others being assimilated by the plantlet and reconverted into
reserve carbohydrates in the tissues of the germ and rootlets,
whilst the remaining portions are retained as such in the finished
malt. Similarly certain of the nitrogenous constituents of
the grain, the proteïns, are broken down and rendered soluble
by proteolytic enzymes, the products being assimilated to a
certain extent by the germ and rootlets, by the cells of which
they are again built up into complex proteïns, whilst others
remain in their simplified form. It is now known that proteolytic
enzymes exist in finished malt, and that, when the
mashing process is conducted under certain conditions, these
are able to degrade and render soluble some of the higher proteïns
present in the malt. When germination is allowed to proceed
as it does when the grain is planted in the soil, the whole of
the contents are rendered soluble by degrees and in turn assimilated
by the growing plantlet. By the limited germination
which constitutes the malting process, however, the balance
of soluble compounds left in the finished malt is from 15 to
25% of the total weight of the corn.</p>

<p>Although other seeds of the natural order Gramineae are
occasionally malted, the greater portion of malt is made from
the various species of <i>Hordeum</i>, known by the name of barley
(<i>q.v.</i>), bigg, or bere. Indeed ordinary beer derives its characteristic
flavour to the greatest extent from barley malt. A small
proportion of malted oats or malted wheat is sometimes used
in conjunction with barley malt for certain kinds of beer, whilst
rye, maize, and even rice are occasionally malted. Barley
is, however, the grain best adapted for making malt intended
for brewing beer, and accordingly some space will be devoted
to a description of those varieties of this grain which are used
by the brewer.</p>

<p>Barley belongs to the genus Hordeum, of which there are
numerous species and varieties. Linnaeus and the earlier
botanists recognized six species of cultivated barleys, but
modern botanists usually consider all cultivated barleys as
belonging to one species to which the name <i>H. sativum</i> has
been given. Körnicke regards <i>H. spontaneum</i>, a very long
thin-grained two-rowed barley (see below) which grows in
the East, as being the parent form; but E. S. Beaven inclines
to the view that wild species of more than one form were
originally used as food and subsequently cultivated. The
last-named author has drawn up a scheme of classification for
the varieties and races of cultivated barleys.</p>

<p class="pt2">In an ear of barley the primary axis or rachis is divided into
internodes of which there may be any number up to forty.
Each internode bears three single-flowered spikelets arranged
alternately on either side of the rachis. In the six-rowed
varieties the whole of these spikelets attain maturity, whilst
in the two-rowed varieties only one on each side of the rachis,
viz. the median, develops. British beer is brewed principally
from the malt made from home-grown two-rowed barleys.
Of late years, however, it has been found advantageous to
employ a proportion of malt made from the thinner and more
husky foreign barleys, mostly six-rowed varieties. The corns
of two-rowed barleys are as a rule plumper than those of six-rowed
barleys.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The most favourite barley for malting purposes grown in the
United Kingdom is the narrow-eared two-rowed <i>H. distichum</i>,
commonly known as Chevallier, from the name of the original cultivator,
the Rev. John Chevallier. Of late years the quantity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page500" id="page500"></a>500</span>
barley of the so-called Goldthorpe type (<i>H. zeocriton</i>), used for malting,
has increased. The paleae or outer coverings of the corns of
this variety are somewhat &ldquo;greasy&rdquo; in appearance, and do not
adhere so closely to the corn as in the Chevallier. The corns of
Goldthorpe barley possess a small dimple or transverse furrow near
the basal end. Further the basal bristle or rachilla (the prolongation
of the axis or point from which the corn was originally developed)
is invariably covered with long hairs, whilst in the case of Chevallier
it has generally very short hairs. In the variety of Chevallier known
as Archer, however, the rachilla has somewhat long hairs. Further
the corns of Chevallier barley lie nearly vertical, that is almost
parallel to the rachis, whereas in Goldthorpe they are spread out at
a greater angle, hence the name fan or peacock barley given to that
variety commonly known as sprat. It is believed by some brewers
that Goldthorpe barleys never yield malt of so high a quality as
do Chevallier barleys. On the other hand, when well matured,
Goldthorpes work evenly and freely on the malting floors; and from
an agricultural point of view they have the advantage of standing
up better against unfavourable weather conditions on account of
their stouter straws. Numerous fresh varieties of barley are continually
being introduced as a result of artificial cross-fertilization,
but cross-fertilization rarely if ever occurs naturally.</p>

<p>Hungarian two-rowed barleys are excellent as regards quality,
and command a high price. The so-called Californian Chevallier
and Chilean Chevallier contain a certain admixture of the six-rowed
<i>H. vulgare</i>.</p>

<p>Of the imported thin barleys may be mentioned Brewing Californian,
Brewing Chilean, Danubian and Smyrna (Yerli), all for the
most part six-rowed varieties; also Ouchak, consisting principally
of a two-rowed variety. For the manufacture of grain spirit a malt
of high diastatic activity is required, and this is largely made from a
very thin barley shipped from Odessa.</p>

<p>In the common six-rowed English barley or Scottish bere (<i>H.
vulgare</i>), the two lateral rows of spikelets springing from one side of
the rachis, either partially or entirely intersect and overlap the alternate
lateral spikelets which spring from the opposite side of the rachis.
This has given rise to the term &ldquo;four-rowed barley.&rdquo; Figs. 1-4
show some typical barleys in the ear.</p>

<p>The production of new varieties by cross-fertilization has of late
years attained a degree of almost mathematical precision by the
application of the law of inheritance first discovered by Gregor
Mendel in 1865, and brought to light in 1901 independently by
de Vries, Correns and Tschermak.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Constitution of Barley.</i>&mdash;A grain of barley is shuttle-shaped;
the end containing the germ which was originally attached
to the rachis is known as the proximal end, whilst the opposite
end of the corn is called the distal end. A deep furrow runs
down the more convex side, which is accordingly denoted
the ventral side, the opposite side being distinguished as the
dorsal side. Within the ventral furrow at the proximal end
is the rachilla already referred to. The skin or husk of a
barleycorn consists of two paleae, one adhering to the dorsal
side (the palea inferior) and the other to the ventral side (the
palea superior); the former overlaps the edges of the latter.
The awn or beard is merely an elongation of the palea inferior.
If the two paleae are removed from a barleycorn after soaking
it in water, it will be seen that there are other skins completely
enveloping the embryo and endosperm. These are the true
skins, and are known as the pericarp and the testa respectively.
It may here be mentioned that A. J. Brown has shown recently
that the embryo and endosperm of a barleycorn are enclosed
in a semi-permeable membrane, <i>i.e.</i> one which allows the passage
of water to the interior of the corn, but not of certain salts
and acids. This property appears to be associated with one
of the layers of the testa. Next to these skins will be seen
the triple layer of thick-walled square-shaped aleurone cells.</p>

<p>The histology of the barleycorn is best studied by the examination
of sections under the microscope. The grain consists
of two main portions, the embryo or germ, and the endosperm,
the storehouse of reserve materials for the growing
plant.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The accompanying illustrations show portions of longitudinal
sections of a barleycorn magnified to different degrees.</p>

<p>On examining fig. 5, which represents a section of the germ end
of a grain of barley cut through the ventral furrow, it will be noticed
that the rudimentary leaves, stem and roots are distinguishable.
The embryo lies embedded in a mass of cells, the part dividing it
from the endosperm being known as the scutellum. Special note
should be taken of the elongated cells known as the absorptive
epithelial layer, which has certain very important functions to fulfil
during the process of germination, notably in feeding the embryo
when it begins to develop into a young plant. Next to this, actually
between the scutellum and the endosperm, will be seen a layer of
empty cells. These at one time in the history and the development
of the corn contained starch granules, but this starch was absorbed
during its later development by the embryo. It will be observed
further that the endosperm is filled with a network of thin-walled
cells closely packed with starch granules, and smaller granules of
proteïn matter (fig. 6). Nearest the skin will be seen the triple
layer of aleurone cells already referred to (fig. 7).</p>

<p class="pt2"><i>Germination.</i>&mdash;The barleycorn in its resting stage is in a
state which may be described as one of dormant vitality; it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page501" id="page501"></a>501</span>
respires very slowly and thus loses weight during storage.
The best and driest barleys are said to lose 1.3% of their weight
in the first year, 0.9% in the second, and 0.5% in the third.
The loss is considerably more with coarse and damp samples.
When the grain is steeped this dormant vitality gives place
to that complicated series of processes comprised under the
general term germination. When germination begins, enzymes
are secreted, and these act on the reserve materials, starch
and proteïns of the endosperm, converting them into simpler
compounds, capable of diffusing to various parts of the growing
germ. Following this, starch and proteïns are re-formed, the
former being deposited in the tissues of the germ and in the
cells of the scutellum, which previously were almost free from
starch; the proteïn matter deposited in the latter disappears
to a considerable extent, and the protoplasmic content of
the cells assumes a very granular appearance. The pointed
mass of cells constituting the root-sheath is pushed forward
by the root which protrudes through the base of the grain.
It is at this stage that the barley is said by the maltster to &ldquo;chit.&rdquo;
After the first rootlet has broken through the ends of the sheath,
it is followed by others. The cotyledonary sheath begins to
elongate on the third or fourth day of germination and ruptures
the true covering of the seed; it then grows upwards between
this and the husk and forms the acrospire or &ldquo;spire&rdquo; of the
maltster.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="pt2">According to Brown and Morris, when the first rootlet is breaking
through the sheath, starch begins to appear in the tissues of the grain,
also in the protoplasm of those cells which are nearest the epithelial
layer, and it gradually invades the deeper-seated cells. Further the
cellulose walls of the endosperm, situated immediately above
the secretory layer, are partially dissolved, the dissolved matter
passing into the scutellum, there to be transformed into starch.
Brown and Morris state that this process gradually extends to the
cellulose walls of the endosperm, and until these are affected there
is no evidence of any solvent action on the starch granules themselves.
Thus according to these authors the first enzyme to be formed is one
which dissolves cell walls, and it was consequently termed by them
a &ldquo;cytohydrolyst.&rdquo; They assert further that the so-called mealy or
modified condition, which the maltster desires to bring about to the
fullest degree, depends on the extent to which the cell walls have been
affected, and they enter into a minute description of the entire disappearance
of these during the malting process. On the other hand,
J. Grüss has pointed out that the action which takes place on the cell
walls of the endosperm during germination does not consist in their
complete solution. Schulze has shown that these cell walls consist of
two carbohydrates, an araban and a xylan. Grüss states that the
araban is completely dissolved, whilst the xylan is more or less unattacked.
The cell walls become, however, transparent so that they
can only be seen in sections which have been stained; Brown and
Morris examined unstained sections. The writer (A. R. Ling) has
proved that the cell wall is present in the most friable and well
modified finished malt.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Condition.</i>&mdash;Barley is bought in the open market solely
on the evidence of certain external signs, and judgment can
only be acquired by long experience. The corns should be
plump, even in size, and the colour should be uniform from
end to end. The sample should have a sweet odour, and it
should be dry to the touch. The presence of light or weevilled
corns may be detected by the fact that they float in water.
Careless threshing or dressing is responsible for much damage
done to barley. In this way many of the corns may be broken,
have the palcae partly stripped off or portions removed along
with the awn. All broken and dead corns are prone to become
mouldy on the malting floors, the contagion thus presented
becoming general. E. R. Moritz drew attention in 1895 to
the ill effects of close dressing, and more recently (1905) the
matter has been brought before the Highland and Agricultural
Society, chiefly through Montagu Baird, who with C. H.
Babington was instrumental in inducing the Board of Agriculture
to publish a leaflet recommending more careful methods
of threshing barley. Close dressing was at one time practised
as a means of raising the bushel weight, and thus giving a
fictitious value to the barley. Immature barley feels cold
to the hand, has a greenish-yellow colour, and, when dry, a
starved wrinkled appearance. Over-ripeness in barley is
distinguished by a white dead appearance of the corn. Mature
or dry grains slip through the fingers more readily than unripe
or damp ones. The contents of the endosperm should present
a white friable or mealy appearance when the corns are bitten
or cut in two with a penknife. The condition of the grain
may be determined by means of a mechanical cutter, which
cuts a certain number of corns (fifty or more) at one time.
Some cutters are constructed to cut the corns transversely,
others to cut them longitudinally. The so-called transparency
test may be used for the same purpose. It is carried out in
an apparatus known as the diaphanoscope, which consists
of a box fitted with a sliding tray, furnished with a certain
number of shuttle-shaped holes (usually 500), each of such a
size as just to hold a barleycorn longitudinally. Into the
portion of the box below this tray an electric lamp is placed,
and the corns are looked at from above. Thoroughly mealy
corns are opaque, whilst steely corns are transparent. When
certain portions of a corn are steely, these present the appearance
of lakes. By this means the percentage of mealy, steely,
or half steely corns in a sample may readily be estimated.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>E. Prior points out that steeliness of barley is of two kinds, one
of which disappears after the grain has been steeped and dried, and
therefore does not necessarily influence the malting value of the
sample, and the other which is permanent, and therefore retards
the modification of the corn. He proposed to determine what he
called the coefficient of mellowness of a sample of barley by means
of the formula:&mdash;</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td rowspan="2">A =</td> <td>(M<span class="su">1</span> &minus; M) 100</td>
<td rowspan="2">+ M,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom">100 &minus; M</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">in which A is the degree of mellowness, M is the percentage of mealy
corns in the original barley, and M<span class="su">1</span> is the percentage of mealy corns
after steeping and drying the barley. Prior points out that, generally
speaking, the degree of mellowness varies inversely as the proteïn
content.</p>

<p>The physical differences between steely and mealy grains were
first investigated by Johansen, who arrived at the conclusion that
mealiness is always accompanied by the presence of air spaces in
the endosperm. Munro and Beaven confirmed and extended this.
Their conclusions are as follow: &ldquo;Mealy grains have a lower
specific gravity than steely grains, and contain a larger amount of
interstitial air. The total nitrogen content of mealy grains is less than
that of steely grains. Steely grains contain a relatively high proportion
of nitrogenous substances soluble (<i>a</i>) in 5% salt solution,
and (<i>b</i>) in alcohol of specific gravity 0.9. Mealy barley modifies
better than steely during germination. The process of drying damp
and under-matured barley intact at 100° F. produced an apparent
mellowing or maturation. Other things being equal, maturation,
which is physiologically a post-ripening process, is correlated with
the mealy appearance of the endosperm.&rdquo; H. T. Brown and his
collaborators point out that thin sections of steely corns when
examined under the microscope no longer exhibit a translucent appearance,
but show the mealy properties as completely as if they had
been cut from a mealy grain, and they suggest that in a steely corn the
whole of the endosperm is under a state of tensile stress which cannot
be maintained in the thin sections. If, however, a thin section of
a steely barley be cemented to a slide with Canada balsam and then
pared away with a razor, steeliness and translucency may be preserved
even in the thinnest sections. The mealy appearance in the
endosperm of barley is assumed to be a direct consequence of the
formation of interspaces around the cell-contents and within the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page502" id="page502"></a>502</span>
cell walls. Under ordinary conditions it is conjectured that these
interspaces are filled with air, but it is pointed out that they can also
be produced under circumstances which suggest that they are at
times vacuous or partly so. According to the last-mentioned
authors they appear to originate from a system of stresses and strains
induced within the endosperm by its gradual loss of water, a break
of continuity taking place which gives rise to these interspaces when
the cohesive power of the heterogeneous cell-contents falls below
a certain point. It is further suggested by them that the most
important factor in producing the stresses and strains is probably
the shrinkage of the starch granules as their water content is reduced
from, say, 40 to about 15%. It is pointed out, however, that actual
discontinuity in the cell-contents can only take place when the
tensile strength of the protoplasmic matrix in which the starch
granules are embedded has been surpassed, and this being so it might
be anticipated that those cells which contain the larger amount
of proteïn material would probably best resist the internal stresses
and strains, a deduction in close agreement with observed facts,
steely grains being as a rule richer in proteïn than mealy grains.
Brown and his co-workers determine the coefficient of mealiness of
a barley as follows: Five hundred corns are cut transversely in a
corn cutter and the percentage of mealy, half mealy and steely corns
is noted. The number 100 is taken to represent complete mealiness,
1 complete steeliness, and 50 the intermediate class. If the percentage
of each class be multiplied by its special value, and the
sum of the products divided by 100, the result is the coefficient of
mealiness. By steeping and drying a very steely Scottish barley,
the coefficient of mealiness was raised from 29.7 to 87.1, whilst
concurrently the specific gravity fell from 1.417 to 1.289.</p>
</div>

<p>Barley even of the same kind varies widely in its chemical
composition, but on an average the proximate constituents
of British malting barleys be within the following limits:&mdash;</p>

<p>Any sample of barley which contains more than 20% of
moisture would be considered damp. The late Professor
Lintner expressed the view several years ago that a good malting
barley should not contain more than 10% of proteïn, but
R. Wahl asserts that in America six-rowed barleys containing
a far higher percentage of proteïn are used successfully, indeed
preferably, for malting purposes. The only precise knowledge
we possess of the proteïn compounds of barley is due to the
researches of T. B. Osborne. According to this observer,
barley contains the under-mentioned compounds of this class
in the following proportions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It should be pointed out here that the above are only average
values for the particular samples of barley investigated. Undoubtedly
the nitrogenous constituents of different barleys vary
widely in nature as well as in amount.</p>
</div>

<p>Raw barley contains enzymes, thus diastase of translocation,
so called by Horace T. Brown and G. H. Morris, and catalase
(H. van Laer). Proteolytic enzymes appear only to arise
with the beginning of germination; but it has been asserted
that raw barley contains proenzymes (zymogens), which can
be rendered active by treatment with dilute lactic acid at an
appropriate temperature. The action of the diastase of raw
barley on starch has been studied by Julian L. Baker.</p>

<p>Barley should not be cut until it is properly ripe, but over-ripeness
is much more to be guarded against by the maltster
than premature cutting, as it is accompanied by a loss in germinative
power. Moreover, unripe corn may to a certain extent
be matured in stack, whilst a great improvement in germinative
capacity is frequently produced by sweating. Very wet seasons
are prejudicial to the ripening of the grain, and when the latter
is stacked in too moist a condition it is apt to become what
is known as mow burnt. Especially is this the case with barleys
containing large percentages of nitrogen and of high enzymatic
activities. Such barleys are denoted &ldquo;warm&rdquo; by M. Delbrück
from their tendency to heat when stored in a moist condition.
The effect of this heating is exhibited in the corns becoming
black and discoloured at the tips; they are then said to be
magpied. Even in an otherwise dry season a large amount
of rain during harvest causes the corns to become &ldquo;weathered,&rdquo;
whilst some of them begin germinating and rot. At the same
time heavy dews at night whilst the barley lies cut in the field,
or even a sprinkling of rain, assists in mellowing the grain,
which often in consequence works the more freely on the malting
floors. Properly harvested barley is all the better for remaining
in stack for two or three months, as was the practice in former
years; if, however, it has been stacked too wet the sooner it
is broken down the better.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It is difficult to give any specific test for ripeness, but a series of
observations has been made by H. T. Brown and F. Escombe.
Samples of barley were taken from the field on the 20th, 24th and
29th of July, and on the 2nd, 6th and 10th of August, and preserved
in spirit so that they remained in the same state as when they were
gathered. Sections were then cut of these corns, when it was found
that the progress of maturation is attended by deformation and
ultimate disintegration of the cell nuclei. The change which is
denoted by the term nuclear senescence is said to begin in the starch-containing
cells, near the periphery of the corn, immediately underlying
the layer next to the aleurone layer. This deformation is
followed by complete disintegration of the nucleus, and at the end
of seven or eight days nearly the whole of the endosperm has been
involved. Brown and Escombe state that when this nuclear test
is properly applied it stamps as immature those corns in a sample
which are manifestly unripe owing to premature desiccation as well
as those in which the ratio of nitrogen to carbohydrate is unduly
high, owing to an excess of nitrogenous manure in the soil, or to
sparser sowing with its consequent reduction of root competition.
This method, interesting though it be, is not fitted for practical
use, and the agriculturist must rely as heretofore upon empirical
methods for deciding whether or not the grain has attained ripeness
or maturity.</p>

<p>The bushel weight is a useful criterion in arriving at an opinion
regarding the value of a sample of barley; but in basing judgment
upon this factor regard must be paid to the fact already mentioned
that if the grains be dressed closely the bushel weight is increased.
The reason of this is that with the removal of the awns the corns
pack more closely together. The best British malting barleys
should weigh 52-56 &#8468; per bushel, the standard weight for malting
barleys being 56 &#8468;.</p>
</div>

<p>During the storage of barley access of air is necessary,
otherwise the grain dies from asphyxiation. Sound barley
after being kiln-dried retains its vitality for a number of years;
but the statement that the corns found in the Egyptian mummy
cases, in which they had remained for several thousands of
years, were still capable of germination, is contrary to modern
experience. Moisture must also be carefully excluded, as it
initiates germination in a few cells only of the endosperm and
causes heating. A constant repetition of wetting such as may
take place on account of alterations of the atmospheric temperature,
which causes moisture to be deposited, in the form
of dew, may ultimately destroy the vitality and foster the
growth and development of mould fungi which usually grow
on broken and damaged corns. In this connexion the advantage
of screening and sweating of barley before storing it will be
apparent (see below).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>An immense amount of damage is caused to the grain, during storage,
by various insects, one of the most destructive of these being the
common weevil (<i>Calandra granaria</i>). When fully developed this
insect measures <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">6</span>th to <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span>th of an inch in length, and is of a bright
chestnut colour. The larvae are fleshy legless grubs, shorter than
the perfect insect, with a series of tubercles along each side of the
body; the head is round with strong jaws. The pupa is white, clear
and transparent, showing the form of the future weevil. The
female bores a hole in the grain with her snout and deposits an egg.
The larva when hatched lives on the contents of the grain and undergoes
its changes therein. Windisch asserts that only barley which
has ripened in the granary is attacked by weevil. Grain which is
only slightly attacked should be kilned at a temperature of 122° F.,
which destroys the weevil in all stages of development. To detect
weevil in a sample of barley, the grain should be spread out on a
sheet of white paper in bright sunlight. If weevils are present they
soon appear, and betake themselves to a position outside the sunlight,
to which they are averse. Treatment of the grain with carbon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page503" id="page503"></a>503</span>
bisulphide has been suggested as a means of destroying weevil;
even if efficacious, however, such a process could not be recommended
on account of its danger, carbon bisulphide being highly
inflammable. The only practical means of ridding a granary or
shop of weevil is to clear out all the grain and leave it empty for a
year or more.</p>
</div>

<p>The vitality of barley may be determined by causing a sample
to germinate in any of the well-known forms of apparatus
devised for that purpose, and counting the percentage of germinating
and idle corns. The germinative capacity of a sample
of barley may frequently be raised by sweating (see below),
which, as already mentioned, brings about a kind of artificial
maturation.</p>

<p><i>Malting.</i>&mdash;There are two systems of malting used in England:
floor malting and pneumatic or drum malting. These systems
will be described separately.</p>

<p>A floor malting consists of a rectangular building of several
storeys, having the cisterns at one end and the kilns at the other.
The uppermost floor is devoted to barley.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 8.</span>&mdash;Longitudinal section of 200 quarter malting at Mortlake. (Julian L. Baker, architect.)</td></tr></table>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Figure 8 shows a longitudinal section of Messrs Watney, Combe,
Reid &amp; Co.&rsquo;s 200 quarter malting at Mortlake. The barley is carried
to the top of the building by the elevator A, where the screening
and dressing machinery is situated. After leaving these machines
the grain is conveyed on bands to the barley floors B and C. The
floor C contains also the steeping cisterns. The six working floors
are D, E, F, G, H, K. The floors are ventilated by louvres, N,
N, N. The cisterns are connected to the floors by means of plugs.
The &ldquo;pieces,&rdquo; as they are termed, of germinating barley are
gradually worked along the floors to the kilns M, M, on to which
they are loaded by rotary bands. The fire-places O, O, are arranged
so that the draught may be easily controlled. The hot air and
products of combustion pass up the shafts P, P, to the hot-air
chamber R, R, where they strike the baffle plates S, S. These
plates disperse the hot air and gases evenly beneath the kiln floors
T, T, through the green malt. After drying and curing, the malt
is allowed to cool and is then carried by bands to the floor U, where
by suitable machinery the coombs or rootlets are removed. The
finished malt is stored in the bins V, V, V.</p>
</div>

<p>On arrival at the malting the barley has to be put through
the following operations seriatim: receiving, hoisting and
weighing, rough screening, drying and sweating, storing until
required for use, screening, grading and removing broken corns,
steeping, couching, flooring, withering, drying and curing,
dressing and polishing, storing, weighing, sacking and discharging
the finished malt.</p>

<p>In sweating barley the temperature should not be allowed
to rise above 120° F.; it is usually conducted at 100° F.; and
subsequently the barley should be stored for some weeks before
it is steeped.</p>

<p>The capacity of a malting is described by the number of
quarters which are put through it every four days. A fifty
quarter malting does not merely mean that the cisterns have a
capacity of fifty quarters, but that this quantity of barley
goes through the house every four days. The average time the
germinating barley is on the floors is twelve days, and, as a
rule, kilning occupies four days. If, as sometimes happens,
the malt has to be kept on the floors thirteen, fourteen, fifteen
days, or even longer, the malting is not being worked at the
capacity under which it is described, and the kilns may remain
unused for a day or more. Conversely, when the malt is loaded
at less than twelve days, a day or two has to be missed in steeping.
In the former case when the kilns are not being used
for drying and curing malt, advantage may be taken to utilize
them for sweating barley.</p>

<p>Steeping cisterns were formerly rectangular vessels, of slate,
brick or cement, from which the barley had to be discharged
by shovelling it out. The forms approved most at the present
day are conical and constructed of iron; they have arrangements
at the apex of the cone, the lower portion, for discharging the
grain by gravitation. The steeping period ranges from 48
to 70 hours; it varies according to the kind of barley, and the
time of the year. In some of the older maltings there are
no arrangements for heating the steep water, and in the winter
steeping has occasionally to be performed with water at a
temperature near its freezing-point. Steeping should be
carried out at a temperature as near as possible to 55° and
not higher than 60° F. The usual practice is to fill the cistern
up to a certain height with water and throw the barley into
it, stirring it until it is about level; the heavy corns will then
sink directly to the bottom, whilst the light corns and refuse
float on the surface and may be skimmed off. During the
time the barley remains in the cistern it is usual to change the
steep water two or three times, generally at intervals of twelve
hours or tides. The advantage of this is not merely to keep
the grain fresh and sweet, but to bring it into contact with the
air during the time it is taking up water. Aëration of the
steep has long been recognized in Germany as promoting germination,
and several arrangements are on the market enabling
air to be passed through the grain while it is in the cistern.
It has been recommended by Graham, Stopes, Moritz and
Morris, and experimental evidence as to its beneficial effects
has been published by Windisch, Bleisch, Will, and Baker and
Dick. When the corn is steep ripe it contains some 60% of
water. Steeping does not consist, however, merely in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page504" id="page504"></a>504</span>
imbibition of a certain amount of water; in order to bring
about germination this water must remain within the corn a
certain length of time. Thus, although it is quite possible
to force the necessary amount of water into the grain in less
than the 48-70 hours usually taken up by the steeping process,
the grain is not steep-ripe until certain changes initiated by
the water have taken place, and these require time for their
completion. The following average data are useful to remember
in connexion with the steeping process:&mdash;</p>

<div class="list">
<p>Amount of water in steep-ripe barley (about) 60%.</p>
<p>Matter removed from barley during steeping (about) 1.5%.</p>
<p>Increase in volume of barley due to water absorption (about) 18-20%.</p>
</div>

<div class="condensed">
<p>There has been much discussion as to the influence of saline matters
in water on the steeping process. The late Professor Lintner stated
that common salt in water tended to extract the nitrogenous constituents
of the grain, but impeded its germination. Mills and
Pettigrew found that waters containing calcium salts extracted a
minimum of nitrogenous compounds from the barley; they also came
to the conclusion that the esteem in which the Lichfield water is
held for steeping purposes is due to the presence of nitrates which,
they assert, have a stimulating effect on the subsequent germination
of the grain. The writer has added lime-water to the extent of one-third
of the total volume of water at the first change, believing
it to promote regularity of germination. Bearing in mind, however,
the observations of Adrian J. Brown, that the barleycorn is enclosed
in a membrane permeable to water but impermeable to most salts,
it is difficult to see how the saline constituents of water can have
any effect except in removing matter from the external portions
of the grain and on those corns which are broken. The apparent
beneficial effect of lime-water in the steep is probably entirely due to
the removal of matters from the husks or paleae.</p>
</div>

<p>Malting floors may be constructed of cement, tiles or slate,
the two former being preferable to the latter. Ford, in 1849,
recommended 200 sq. ft. per quarter of barley steeped as the area
of the working floors, and he was quite convinced of the necessity
of allowing ample floor room, so that the grain could be worked
on the slow, cool system. Subsequently, however, maltsters
reduced their floor area, and put the grain rapidly through the
malting, thus producing what is termed &ldquo;forced&rdquo; malt. This
kind of malt was, however, condemned by practical brewers,
and a chemical test whereby forcing could be detected having
been devised by E. R. Moritz and G. H. Morris, maltsters
have been compelled again to increase the area of their working
floors. At the present time the approved area may be
placed at 175-200 sq. ft. per quarter of barley steeped. The
area is, however, largely ruled by the kind of barley to be
malted.</p>

<p>After the barley has been thrown out of the cistern it is made
up in a rectangular heap 16-20 in. deep, called the &ldquo;couch&rdquo;;
the object of this is to enable it to gather heat and so start germinating.
It usually remains in couch for 12-24 hours, until in
fact the interior portion of the heap registers a temperature of
about 60° F. During the days of the malt tax the exciseman
gauged the quantity of the barley while it was in the couch.
After couching the barley is spread thinly and evenly on the
floor, forming what is known as the young floor or No. 1
piece. The first visible sign of germination is the sprouting of
the rootlet, termed &ldquo;chitting,&rdquo; and this occurs either while the
grain is on the couch or on the young floor. As already mentioned,
it may be quickened by aerating the grain in the cistern. From
the time the barley is first cast out of the cistern up to the stage
of the young floor, or No. 1 piece, it has a pleasant ethereal
odour resembling apples. Drs Thomson, Hope and Coventry
stated in the earlier part of the 19th century that they distilled
&ldquo;spirits&rdquo; from germinating barley at this stage. In the light
of our present knowledge it would not be surprising if alcoholic
fermentation were proved to occur within the grain at this stage,
since intramolecular or anaerobic respiration in certain vegetables
has been found to be due to alcoholic fermentation.</p>

<p>The thickness at which the young floor is spread depends upon
the outside temperature and the nature of the barley. If the
weather be warm, or if there be a tendency for the barley to heat,
the piece must be spread all the thinner. At this stage the
grain loses its external wet appearance. When spread too thickly
the grain will begin to sweat, and the rootlets will be thrown
out suddenly and unevenly. As a rule, under these circumstances,
the rootlets will be long and thin, when they are said
to be &ldquo;wild.&rdquo; A piece which has been allowed to get into this
condition must at once be spread thinner. If the sweating has
not continued long, the harm done may be confined to increased
loss by respiration. The young floor is usually turned with a
plough twice during twelve hours, and it may be forked between
whiles, but no hard and fast rule can be laid down as to when
this is necessary; it must be left to the maltster&rsquo;s judgment,
as it depends entirely on what is going on within the grain. The
object of turning is in the first place to aerate the grain and
freshen it, secondly to check excessive rise of temperature, and
thirdly to promote evenness of growth. Too frequent turning
is not to be advised. After remaining four days on the young
floor three or four rootlets should have appeared, and the acrospire
should have begun to grow up the back of the corn. The
apple-like odour of the piece then gives place to one resembling
that of the common rush, and this should continue the whole
time that the malt remains on the floor. On the fifth day the
piece is next moved to No. 2 position, a stage nearer the kiln.
It is here that sprinkling is resorted to when necessary. The
amount of sprinkling and the time it is given cannot be exactly
prescribed. The amount may vary from two to five gallons per
quarter, and it should only be given when the rootlets, which
ought to be short and curly, and five or more in number, show
signs of losing their freshness. If an excessive amount of sprinkling
be given forced growth ensues. It is preferable not to add
the whole of the water at one time, but to divide it over two
lots; and immediately after the piece has been sprinkled it should
be thoroughly and carefully mixed, otherwise some of the grain
will receive an undue proportion of water. When all the sprinkling
water has been given to the piece, which as a rule should not
be done later than at the sixth or seventh day of flooring, the
temperature should be kept down to about 55° F. by turning.
Too frequent turning may, however, detach the rootlet, and it
may cause the grain to lose its vitality prematurely, so that
growth of the acrospire stops.</p>

<p>By about the eighth day of flooring the acrospire should be
about three-quarters up the corn. After this the germinating
corn is moved forward to No. 3 piece, which is at first
spread as thinly on the floors as in the previous pieces. Here
it gradually dries and incipient withering of the rootlets sets
in. The only treatment which is now given to the grain
is to heap it up thicker and thicker by degrees until it is
ready for loading on the kiln. This increase in thickness of
the piece (now called the old piece) should not be too sudden,
especially if the grain be fresh in appearance and contain
a large quantity of water. When the piece is thickened up
to say 10 in. in depth, while it is in a very moist condition,
heating and sweating take place, with additional growth
of acrospire and rootlet. Under such forcing conditions
a large production of sugar and degradation of the proteïns
will take place. When, however, the moisture has been gradually
reduced before thickening up, the rootlet dies off; and although
increase of temperature may occur, this is accompanied
by little or no further growth of the acrospire, action being confined
to the mellowing of the grain by the enzymes. When the
malt is ready for loading on the kiln it should be possible to
break down the contents of each corn between the thumb and
finger. Opinions differ as to what the final temperature on the
withering floor should be. If the moisture content of the malt
be about 50%, the piece must be kept thin to avoid sweating.
But under these conditions mellowing does not occur, hence the
necessity of reducing the moisture content gradually after the
last sprinkling water has been given. When the process has
been conducted properly the temperature of the old piece may be
allowed to rise as high as 70° F. during the six hours previous to
loading. The moisture content of the green malt when loaded
should not be much above 40%.</p>

<p>The endosperm of green malt which is ready for the kiln
should be soft and mealy, and should not exude moisture when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page505" id="page505"></a>505</span>
pressed between the thumb-nails, but should crumble and disintegrate
to a chalky mass having little or no adhesiveness.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The foregoing observations are not to be regarded as hard and
fast rules, but they are simply intended to give some indications of
the malting process when it proceeds on normal lines; it may be that
on account of the presence of damaged corns the piece begins to
develop mould by about the tenth day, and it then has to be kept
thin and sometimes even loaded on kiln prematurely.</p>
</div>

<p>The malt made for grain distillers, in which a high diastatic
activity is required, is manufactured on quite different lines
from those above indicated. It is often sprinkled late, and loaded
on kiln often in a sodden condition. In some cases sprinkling
on kiln is resorted to, but it is doubtful if this leads to the desired
object. Other things being equal, the smaller the corns&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
the greater number of embryos in a given weight&mdash;the higher the
diastatic activity of the malt. In selecting a barley for the production
of highly diastatic malt, the diastatic power of the
original raw grain is a factor of great importance.</p>

<p><i>Kilning.</i>&mdash;When loaded on kiln, malt intended for brewing
ale and stout is, if properly withered, in a moribund condition;
nevertheless, during the first stages of the kilning process a
certain amount of vital activity is manifested, and the malt
undergoes mellowing by the action of enzymes on the contents
of the endosperm. If the malt be loaded while the rootlets
appear fresh on account of the presence of too much moisture,
rapid growth of the acrospire ensues, giving rise to overshot
corns, known in Germany as &ldquo;hussars.&rdquo; To check this the
moisture must be rapidly removed by the passage of large
volumes of air through the malt. But under such circumstances
mellowing does not occur. The ideal conditions of kilning are
when the malt has been properly withered on the floors before
loading, and, assuming that drying and curing occupy four days,
that 25-30% of the moisture be removed very gradually, this
occupying the first three days, at the end of which the malt is
said to be hand-dry. The thickness at which the malt is spread
on the kiln should not exceed 7-8 in., and until hand-dry (that
is to say, reduced to a moisture content of 12-15%) it should
not be turned; if moved at all (and that only is necessary when
reek occurs), it should only be lightly forked. The rate at which
the temperature is raised depends largely on the kind of malt to
be made and the construction of the kiln. If high flavour and
colour are required, these are produced by keeping the malt for
several hours near a temperature of 160° F. while it still contains
12-15% of moisture. If more than this amount of moisture
be present when the temperature reaches the limit just
mentioned, the conditions known as stewing would obtain, with
the result that &ldquo;forced&rdquo; malt would be produced. A certain
amount of colour is produced at the final temperature to which
the malt is raised; but when such means are relied upon for the
production of the greater part of the colour, reduction of extract
and deficiency of flavour follow, the colour being then almost
exclusively the result of caramelization of the carbohydrates.</p>

<p>The so-called curing stage constitutes the last part of the
kilning process, and the malt must then be turned frequently to
ensure uniformity of action. Mechanical turners are exceedingly
useful for this purpose. Curing in a drum, as in the so-called pneumatic
malting process (see below), also effects satisfactory curing.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The following table will give an idea of the kilning temperatures
usually employed for the three kinds of malt mentioned, but it must
be remembered that these temperatures are largely regulated by the
construction of the kiln and the amount of draught available. In
this connexion it may be mentioned that the final curing temperature
is not necessarily a criterion of the tint of the malt. A malt may have
been finished off at a very high temperature and still be a pale malt,
provided the moisture percentage has been sufficiently reduced in the
initial stages of kilning.</p>

<p><i>Metabolic Changes.</i>&mdash;All through the malting process metabolic
changes are proceeding, in which both carbohydrates and proteïns
are concerned. In its resting stage the embryo of a barleycorn
is generally free from starch; as soon as germination sets
in, however, starch appears in the scutellum, while the amount
of sucrose there present increases, these being apparently formed
from maltose originating from the action of diastase on the starch
of the endosperm. Sucrose also augments in the aleurone layer,
but starch is never formed in the aleurone cells. These changes
occur when the malt is first loaded on kiln; indeed, at no part of
the malting process is there greater physiological activity.</p>

<p>Kilning has been specially studied by J. Grüss, who divides the
process into four stages, the first being that at which the temperature
limit is 113° F. It is characterized by a continuation of the
living processes, especially growth of the acrospire, which, as
already stated, proceeds too far if the malt be loaded too wet. In
any case the rootlet dies away. The metabolism of the carbohydrates
already mentioned is accompanied by that of the nitrogenous
constituents, the reserve proteïn of the sub-aleurone
layer being attacked by proteolytic enzymes and broken down
into simpler compounds. This is a most important matter
from the point of view of the brewing value of barley, for the
degradation products of the proteïns are necessary constituents
of wort as yeast food. Moreover, unless proper modification
of these proteïn bodies occurs it is impossible to produce tender
malt. A barley which contains a high percentage of reserve
proteïn is as a rule unfitted for malting purposes, and indeed, the
higher the proteïn content the greater the difficulty the maltster
experiences in dealing with it. Proteïn hydrolysis requires
the presence of a certain amount of moisture, and if this be
removed too rapidly by a forced draught at the early stages of
kilning the proteolytic enzymes cannot perform their function.
If, on the other hand, the grain be loaded in too moist a condition,
and the temperature be raised too quickly, the proteolytic
enzymes lose their activity and the proteïns remain for the most
part unattacked. When germination is allowed to proceed on
the kiln too great degradation of the proteïn occurs, and the malt
is liable to produce fretty beers, on account of the presence of an
excessive amount of nitrogenous nutritive matter, which leads
to the development of disease organisms.</p>

<p>The second stage of the kilning process, according to Grüss,
is that at which the temperatures range from 113° to 167° F.
The life of the corn is now suspended, but enzymatic processes
continue. The starch is further saccharified, and the dividing
line of the aleurone layer at the furrow is attacked, as are also
the cell walls of the endosperm, which are still intact, these being
partially converted into gummy substances. This change,
however, also requires the presence of a certain amount of moisture.
If too much air be passed through the malt at this stage
the above-named dividing partition of the cell walls is not
attacked. The air may expand the grain to some extent and
produce malt of a low bushel weight, which, however, is not
properly modified and cannot give satisfactory results in
practice.</p>

<p>During the third stage of kilning, an enzyme, which Grüss
claims to have recognized, and which he denotes spermoxidase,
is said to exert its activity.</p>

<p>Schönfeld has confirmed the discoveries of Grüss by practical
experiments.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Fuel.</i>&mdash;The fuel used for drying and curing malt is either anthracite
or coke, and the greatest care is necessary in selecting it on
account of its liability to contain arsenic, which is to a greater or
less extent an invariable constituent of all coal. The fuel used for
malting purposes should not contain more arsenic than <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">20</span>th grain
per &#8468;. Gas coke should on no account be used, unless it has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page506" id="page506"></a>506</span>
proved to be sufficiently free from arsenic; but the best oven coke
frequently contains so little arsenic that it may be employed with
perfect safety, especially if it be mixed with a proportion (<i>e.g.</i> 5%)
of milk of lime, which retains the arsenic as calcium arsenate. In
Germany malt is, as a rule, dried and cured with hot air, whilst in
Great Britain the products of combustion are passed through the
malt, as it is believed that they exert a beneficial influence on the
flavour. The proportion of fuel used for drying and curing malt
varies according to the quality of the fuel and the construction of the
kiln, but on an average it may be placed at 50-80 &#8468; per quarter.</p>

<p><i>Storing.</i>&mdash;After the malt has passed through the curing stage it is
generally heaped up for a few hours. This is believed to increase its
flavour. The malt is then stripped from the kiln, and the rootlets,
technically known as the coombs, are removed. Formerly this was
effected by workmen treading the malt, who wore heavy boots for
the purpose. At the present time, however, the rootlets are usually
removed by machinery, special forms of which have been devised
for this as well as for dressing and polishing the malt. It is the
custom of some maltsters to store malt with the rootlets still attached;
but this is an objectionable practice, since malt coombs attract
moisture, and the presence of more than 3% of moisture in malt
produces the condition known as &ldquo;slackness.&rdquo; When the malt
is packed in bin it is often covered with a layer of coombs, which then
prevent access of atmospheric moisture. Malt, to preserve its good
qualities intact, should be stored in bins made as nearly as possible
air-tight, and it should never be placed in bin until it is quite cool.
It is probably wrong to store malt in bins adjacent to the kilns,
where it is kept at a higher temperature than that of the surrounding
atmosphere. During storage of the malt a kind of mellowing occurs,
the mechanism of which is not understood. It is, however, known
by practical brewers that the best results cannot be obtained when
new malt is used.</p>

<p><i>Premature Malting.</i>&mdash;Several years ago Galland suggested germinating
barley in a drum, his idea being to do away with handling
of the grain, and also to be independent of changes of atmospheric
temperature. The latest development of this system, the so-called
Galland-Henning process of pneumatic malting, has been improved
by Mr R. Blair Robertson, and a diagrammatic view of the interior
of one of these maltings, showing the drums and conical steeping
cisterns, is shown in fig. 9.</p>

<p>The drums are provided with a perforated channel for the passage
of air through the malt, which is packed in the annular space between
this channel and outside wall of the drum. Each drum is capable
of revolving on its axis, and there are arrangements for passing
either moist, saturated or dry air through the malt. The system as
now improved is capable of producing some of the best malt,
especially if, after germination has been completed in the drums,
the green malt is loaded on an ordinary kiln and the initial stages
of kilning (see above) conducted in the usual way; the curing,
however, may be carried out successfully in a special form of
drum.</p>

<p><i>Yield and Weight.</i>&mdash;The malting process is attended with a certain
amount of loss of dry substance of the barley, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl">In the steep</td> <td class="tcc">1.5</td> <td class="tcc">to</td> <td class="tcr">2.0%</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">By respiration on floors and on kilns</td> <td class="tcc">3.0</td> <td class="tcc">&rdquo;</td> <td class="tcr">5.0%</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tcl">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Total</td> <td class="tcc">7.5</td> <td class="tcc">&rdquo;</td> <td class="tcr">11.0%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In addition to this, barley, as already mentioned, contains from 15
to 20% of moisture, whereas finished malt contains 1 to 2%. The
total loss in weight which barley undergoes in the malting process
may be put down at from 17 to 28%. Since, however, malt is
lighter than barley (and the quantity of both was in former years
measured exclusively by volume), it frequently happens that a given
number of quarters of barley yields a larger number of quarters of
finished malt. When this happens it is usual to speak of an increase
having been obtained. At the present time weight replaces measure
for both barley and malt, and although it is usual to speak of the
quantity of grain in terms of quarters, what is meant is not the
measured quarter, but so many weighed standard quarters. The
standard quarter for English malting barley is 448 &#8468; and for malt
336 &#8468;. From this it will be seen that when a given number of
weighed quarters of barley yields the same number of quarters of
finished malt, the actual yield is 75%, and there is then said to be
neither increase nor decrease. As a rule, in practical working the
yield of malt varies from a 4% decrease to a 10% increase, corresponding
to an actual yield on the original barley of 72 to 82.5%.</p>

<p>J. Baverstock, an old writer, says that finished malt should weigh
one-fifth less than the barley from which it is produced. This corresponds
to a malting increase of about 7%, which is a high yield.
As a rule, foreign barley will give a greater malting increase than
English barley, because, on the one hand, the former usually contains
less moisture than the latter, and, further, because there is less loss
on the floors by respiration and rootlet growth.</p>

<p>The yield of malt from barley may be determined in the laboratory
in an extremely simple manner. Since every grain of barley must
yield a grain of malt, if we know the respective weights of a definite
number of barley and malt grains, provided that this number is
large enough to represent the average, then obviously this gives the
data requisite for calculating the yield of malt from barley. The
number of corns the weight of which is determined for this purpose
is usually 1000, and if the weight of this number be determined on
several different 1000 corns, the average will closely approximate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page507" id="page507"></a>507</span>
to the truth. Instead of counting the corns by hand, an instrument
may be used for this purpose.</p>

<p>If 1000 corns of a barley were found to weigh 42 grammes, and
1000 corns of a finished malt from the same barley 32 grammes,
then the yield of malt is (32 × 100)/42 = 76.1, this corresponding to a
1% increase. Assuming that the moisture content of the barley
was 15% and that of the finished malt 2%, 100 grammes of malt
will contain 2 grammes of moisture, and 76.1 grammes will contain
(76.1 × 2)/100 = 1.5 grammes moisture; therefore 76.1 grammes of malt
contain 76.1 &minus; 1.5 = 74.6 grammes of dry matter. This was
obtained from 100 &minus; 15 = 85 grammes of barley dry substance.
Hence 100 parts of barley dry substance will yield (74.6 × 100)/85 = 87.7
corresponding with a loss of dry substance equal to 12.5% of the
dry substance of the barley, or with a loss of 10.7% on the barley
containing 15% of moisture.</p>

<p>The results obtained by this method of laboratory control when it
is accurately carried out agree very closely with those deduced from
the practical results of weighing the barley, malt and coombs in the
malting.</p>

<p><i>Special Malts.</i>&mdash;In addition to the kinds of malt considered in
what precedes, there are others mostly used for imparting specific
flavours and colour to beers and stout. These are crystal malt,
imperial malt, brown or blown malt, and black or roasted malt.
Crystal malt is grown for a shortened period on the floors, and then
placed in a wire cylinder, which is rotated over a fire so that it is
dried at a very high temperature. The weight per quarter is from
250 to 280 &#8468;. Imperial malt is dried off on an ordinary kiln at a
final temperature of 240-270° F., but it is not allowed the usual length
of time on the withering floor. It is placed on the drying kiln in a
layer not exceeding one inch and a half in thickness. A moderate
heat from burnt wood is first applied until the bulk of the moisture
has been driven off, when the temperature is suddenly raised so that
the grains swell some 25% and the malt takes up a strong empyreumatic
flavour from the products of combustion. This kind of
malt weighs 270-300 &#8468; per quarter. Black or roasted malt is prepared
by roasting malt in a cylinder. Ford states that perfectly
malted corn gives a colour of less intensity and permanence than does
partially malted corn, and this has been confirmed by other observers.
A certain quantity of the so-called black malt is actually made from
raw barley, but this gives a product of inferior flavour. The weight
per quarter of black malt varies as much as from 215 to 290 &#8468;.</p>

<p><i>Valuation.</i>&mdash;For the valuation of malt the following determinations
are usually carried out: Extract per standard quarter,
moisture, diastatic activity by the Lintner process, tint, and matters
soluble in cold water. The physical examination of malt is also a
matter of importance, inasmuch as direct evidence is obtained thereby
of the modification of the malt. Among the methods adopted for
this purpose may be mentioned counting the percentage of corns
in which the acrospire has grown up to one-half, two-thirds and three-fourths
the entire length of the corn. In properly made malt the
modification of the endosperm should proceed <i>pari passu</i> with the
growth of the acrospire. The sinker test is also useful when carried
out in an intelligent manner. Those corns which sink in water
and lie flat are improperly modified. Normal malt has a specific
gravity less than water and the corns have equal density throughout;
consequently they float horizontally in water. In forced samples
the proximal ends are frequently lighter than the distal ends, and the
corns float horizontally in water, with the germ directed upwards.
The latter, however, may in some cases fill with water, and the corns
lie flat or sink. This is a characteristic of over-modified malt.
It will be seen from these remarks that it is essential to carry out
the sinker test under standard conditions. The modification of the
malt may also be determined by means of the diaphanoscope already
referred to under Barley.</p>
